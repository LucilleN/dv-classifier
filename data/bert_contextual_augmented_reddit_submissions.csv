"domesticviolence","throwaway__5158","even how quickly can i help my friend?","i've been best friends with ann for about six years. we met in college, she was from out of state and living with her then - boyfriend ( now husband ) franklin in the dorms. after one year at college, she couldn't get loans to stay out here, so she and franklin moved back to pennsylvania ( where she's from ). i visited as often as i could ( once every four months, usually ). from college on, she and franklin lived together, first at college, then in her parents'house, then in an apartment with roommates. they were high school sweethearts and after 5 years they got married. they just celebrated their 3rd anniversary. i was in the wedding, and was only one of two people who wasn't family at the wedding. i get along great with her parents and sister, and have even visited just to celebrate birthdays. six weeks ago, i went out to girls night with ann and another friend. during this time, ann started talking about how she and franklin were constantly fighting over her texting a co - worker, and his unwillingness to find a job ( he can't find a job in his field, and refuses to work at target while still looking for a career job ). she admitted that she was flirting with the co - worker because she was unhappy with her marriage. during this time, franklin decided to track her phone, see who she was texting, and picked a fight with her over text message, telling her he wants a divorce. he started drinking heavily at that point in the evening. at 5 : 30am, i get a call from ann asking if i can please come visit her, she's in the hospital because she and franklin got into a fight. i rushed over, took the day off work, and stayed with her until she was discharged. she got 6 stitches across her elbow from falling into a wine glass ( you could see tendon through the cut ). she was covered in blood and bruised all over ( his handprint had fully formed in bruises by the end of the day ). we attempted to go back to her apartment because she wanted to kick him out, check on their dogs and clean the place up. ann was convinced if i came along, franklin would be forced to act normal. one mistake was agreeing to this, because franklin too was sleeping and when ann woke him up to ask him to leave, he was still very much unhinged. he started alternating between screaming at her, asking her if she cheated, and telling me to leave. he became agitated when i refused, due to ann's insistence i stay, and threw my purse out the door, before threatening to dump it out the window next. ann grabbed some basic supplies to stay the night at my place and we left to go to my apartment. ann reached out to franklin's mother and told her what was going on, that she thought franklin needed help and could his mother please come get him? the mother agreed, and told ann she had picked him up. so a few hours later, ann and i headed back to her apartment. franklin was standing in the middle living room. he had his mother cover for him. over the next 3 hours i waited outside while they talked things over. franklin left for not even 3 days before coming back to the apartment on a permanent basis. he showed up with flowers the day after to apologize to ann. about a week after this, i spent time with ann and she confided in me that, while he had never been violent before, that he had cheated on her twice, and that he has had issues with depression, which she suspected was occurring now as well. she detailed their fight to me, which consisted of him throwing her around the apartment, choking her until she almost passed out multiple times, throwing one of their dogs at her while telling her that she was useless and unfit to care for anything, and repeatedly saying "" one of us is going to die tonight "" and "" i want to make you feel how you made me feel "". franklin claims that he doesn't remember any of it, which is inconsistent with both the conversation that was had in the morning of the fight ( he never denied anything while ann tried to leave ) and the amount of alcohol he was drinking ( given his tolerance, weight, and time elapsed, he shouldn't have been blackout drunk ). i pointed this out to ann and she said she had thought that as well. i have barely seen her over the past few weeks because i refuse to speak to her husband, who claims he's hurt by my actions and "" considered me family before i took ann's side "". i'm angry with how he treated ann, how he treated me, and his unwillingness to understand that either action i took ( either staying in the apartment or leaving ) would have been "" taking a side "". i can't understand how she can sleep next to him, let alone forgive him that quickly. she keeps saying she wants to forget it ever happened, and i no longer have many opportunities to see her because she can't hang out alone with me because he gets mad. no one else knows what has happened, despite my urgings to tell her mother. initially they agreed that they would seek counseling, but they are barely making rent as it is, and, to my knowledge, no mention of that has been brought up since. she has also gotten a second job, and, again, to my knowledge, he still doesn't have one. i don't know what to do. my inaction so far, in regards to not telling her mother, or not insisting more ardently that she needs to leave him, is because i'm scared that i'll alienate her and if this continues to happen, she won't have an outlet or someone to talk to. i keep reiterating to her that i care about her and that i always will, and that i'll always be there for her, but i can tell she doesn't believe it. it concerns me how quickly she was willing to let him back in. if they had time apart, i could gradually try to convince her to leave him, but this now seems impossible. please help. what can, or should, i do?","1j14gu","","5","8","1374764966","Assistance","0.00347142857143"

"" for anyone who doesn't watch the office, toby is completely innocent, and michael is just a socially - inept person who hates toby. it reminded me that today, randomly, a woman came into my store asking about security for her house ( i'm a shop locksmith who helps run our work space as well as our show room, which is essentially a store for lock - related items ). so i brought it up and was telling him the tiny story. i thought he was paying attention, though he wasn't looking at me. i told him how initially, the woman came into the store, and immediately i felt concerned, because she looked disheveled, homeless, and acted like she might be a little off. i was concerned because i thought she might cause trouble in the store, because i judged her as a vagrant. but of course, i still acknowledged her politely. turns out, i learned as she poured her heart out to me, that she was a recent rape victim, and even though her repeated rapist was now on house arrest, she was concerned for her safety at her home because he had escaped house arrest before. she was desperate to find some sort of alarm or deterrent to a possible intruder. unfortunately, the security she was looking for was not something we could provide, but being a fellow abuse victim, i was able to refer her to several abuse advocates, support groups, clinics and shelters that could give her needed professional help. it was at this point he burst out laughing. i was stunned. what. the. fuck? i sat there looking at him, disgusted and appalled, before he finally looked at me and said, "" oh, i was laughing at the t. v. sorry.

"" too late.... i'm fed up. police arrive, im wayy down the street so i cant hear them, but i can see them. they eventually look like they are having a normal conversation and the cop let's him out of the cuffs... i know how he can seem so innocent so that's probably why.... the cop ends up taking him in the cop car to the hospital because of the scuicide attempt... of course not before letting me see him in tears apologizing like crazy... my heart sank... i hate feeling responsible for that. anyways while he was in the hospital i went to the court house and filled out an order of protection completely.... i almost turned it in... then i just stuck it in my purse and left.... it still sits in my purse.... waiting. after he came home we went through the plans of him moving out and us having joined custody of our son... he was fine with this until a couple days later. he wrote a long letter and bought flowers and had me fully convinced he was going to change.... he did... for about a week or two, and here we are a month from the incident... and there's no affection anymore... the cycle is starting again.... i can't leave him during the holidays... too much stress... he has his phone linkedto my google searches on my phone, and has destroyed our home computer","1rbpuh","","4","5","1385259941","Assistance","0.0717212765957"

"" "" how do you reward your child? "" my father had written in "" food "" for each answer. in high school, things only got worse. i became clinically depressed. my father had also begun physically abusing me. i stopped asking for help because nothing happened. once when i was in the hospital they said they were calling child services. we never heard from them. after my father choked me i called the cops. they actually told me if anyone was going to jail it would be me because he had scratch marks on his arm and they saw no marks on me. the scratch marks were from me trying to get him off of me. no teachers at school ever questioned me. when i was 16 my father left in the morning after my mom went to work. none of us had any warning and i was sleeping in my room when he left. this permanently fractured my remaining relationship with my mother because she never believed that i slept through him moving since he took furniture and large items with him. she actually accused me of helping him move. i really did sleep through it all and nobody believed me. this left me with abandonment issues that i still struggle with. a few years after this my mother died and i moved out on my own. i was feeling very scared and vulnerable. i had been talking to an older man online ( 13 years older ) for a few bad years ( i was 19 at this time ) and he seemed like a great guy. i invited him to live with me and things were great for a few months. quickly though, he started going to drink heavily ( it started with just a few beers and by the end was everclear straight from the bottle ) and he started to show signs of violence. he would yell and throw things. for example, when i got home from work if i did not want to eat the meal he cooked because i was full he would scream and throw the plates around. after a few months of this behavior he began to hit me. it started with slapping, then escalated to hitting me with a belt and the worst was when he beat me with the marble base of a bowling trophy. throughout this time we moved a couple times because we kept getting evicted. he couldn't hold down a job and stole our rent / bills / grocery money for liquor all the time. my brothers continued to be horrible. i had gained weight and was now bigger than i had ever been. i was treated horribly and told i was worthless and no good ( from my brothers ). from my ex he would call me disgusting and tell me i was lucky to have him because nobody else could ever want me. well, of course i believed all of this. he went to prison for an alcohol related charge and while he was gone, with the help of a wonderful person, i worked two jobs to save enough money to move. i moved across country and in all respects i am doing well. it's been five years now. i am in my last year of undergrad and my grades are excellent. i have a wonderful fiance who is the most kindest most gentle man ever. we just bought our first home, a mobile home, and we are trying for a baby. however, i just can't be happy. i had initially lost a lot of weight, but i have since gained it back so i am as heavy as i was at my peak. this makes me feel awful and just think of all the things people told me, that i was disgusting and so on. it also makes me feel like i am not in control of my body. in some ways i feel like my ex is still in control because of my weight. remember, i had gained the weight initially because he basically forced me to eat. he even told me at one point he was making me gain weight so that i couldn't leave him. this makes me feel awful and i desperately want to lose weight, but it has been a hard struggle and i have not been successful yet. so in short, i feel like my fiance can't actually love me because fat people aren't worth loving. not to mention i feel that if my own father could abandon me at the age of 16 then there is no reason my fiance could not as well. i worry my fiance doesn't actually love me and only thinks that he does, because i must be disgusting and unworthy and all that. this is the most i have ever talked about this. i can't open up and talk about this without feeling immense shame. there is a lot i am leaving out of this post, but i think this is all the main points. i have tried to go to counseling but i just can't talk about it and so it is not effective. all i want is to be able to feel secure and happy in the love of my fiance. basically, i saw i can't accept that i was abused because part of me still thinks i must have deserved all of it. i also live in denial. i never think of myself as an abuse victim or survivor, and when i think about it i just try and push it away. i'm not sure what to do, or where to go from here to be able to move past it. i know this might make me sound awful, but a lot of times i wish my ex was just dead so that i could move on.","1lkg7j","","8","3","1378112348","","-0.0661532467532"

"" they didn't know that i knew how to keep a secret, because i had my own . i would just forget. if something has to be a secret, then the only way to make that happen is forget. my mom often tells me what i was like as a kid,'cos i have a very small memory of my childhood that normal adults would remember. she told me i never spoke to anyone. i would keep to myself. if anyone tried to talk to me, i would start talking about nothing that would make sense and often forget where i was and what i was doing. i sound adorable, but hella lost and confused. that was the beginning of my denial and the first stages of my dissociative state. i'm now 29 years old. i'll be 30 in september. i have no idea who the hell i am. these basic building blocks of personality that everyone else has, i don't. my hymen was broken when either my father or his best friend inserted a pencil inside of me. my mother took me to the pediatrician, which is the only reason we know. my mother said she asked me and i had no idea wtf she was talking about. i think i was about 5 or 6. maybe 7? i don't know. see what i mean? i do recall my mom being incredibly pissed at me, but that was about it. she thought i was some sort of child sex - pervert. i do recall fucking my stuffed animals a lot. usually in the closet, because i knew it all had to be a secret. sometimes she would catch me and instead of asking me how i knew to take off all my clothes and how to lay down properly, she just assumed i was a sex - pervert. pretty awesome stuff, huh? anyway, even as a kid, all of us who were "" sex - perverts "" managed to gravitate to one another. i never realized it at the time, though, that we were all abused. i just thought all kids were like me and these 2 other girls. i remember, when we were little in daycare, we'd take turns "" tickling "" each other's privates in the bathroom. my mother never really understood, though all the signs were there about my father. of course, me being the best secret - keeper ever, i just forgot. i thought i did, at least. i started getting flashbacks very young. around the same time that all of this was happening, actually. i am not going to talk about it here, though. i knew, but i just thought they were dreams. they were scary, but there weren't really any monsters except for my dad. they were scary, but very normal, if you will. when i say "" normal "", i mean i didn't feel like anything was surreal about it, though i knew it wasn't really happening. my feelings during the course, though, those were happening. eh, let's just skip forward some more,'cos i am rambling entire too much, when i don't really want to and that wasn't my point of coming here. anyway, fast forward to now. i have 2 degrees. everyone thinks i'm beautiful. i don't see it. i modeled for a while and retired a year ago. i still feel hideous. lately, when i look in the mirror, i see my dad's face. i want to cut my face off. oh, by the way, have i mentioned i am a cutter?'cos i am. i cut myself a lot for a myriad of reasons. i am hoping that i won't actually act on cutting my face, but i really want to. unfortunately, his genetics are in mine. i don't want them to be in me anymore. i think he's been in me plenty. when i look in the mirror i don't want to see him. it's funny,'cos most people say i look like my mom. obviously they would say that, because nobody has ever met my dad, hahahaha. i look like him, though. which is a shame, because he's fucking ugly. anyway, so that is question 1 ) any tips on how to look in the mirror and not see the genetics that fucked you over? now, for my greatest question : how the fuck do i lead a normal life? before a single one of you tell me to go to a therapist, know that i have been in and out of therapy since i was in 2nd grade. i've spent a lot of time with a lot of women and 1 dude in a room telling them or not telling them about my feelings. the only reason i opened up to the friend who told me to post here, is'cos i am sick of bottling my shit up when it comes to interpersonal relationships. i can tell a therapist all i goddamn want to, but at the end of the day, we're not gonna watch movies and drink beers together, you know? i'd like to think that i can fill someone in on what a disaster i've become, but still know i can go down a couple beers and make fun of weird outfits with that person. i don't get that out of therapy. now when i say "" normal life "" i mean, primarily, how the hell do i date? i'm so so so incredibly nervous. my last therapist told me that men who went through this become perpetrators and girls, like me, often have a relationship with them. we lack the ability to see the "" red flags "", as she put it. i feel like i'm going to die alone. i mean, sure, i can adopt a kid, but i want all those nice things like a family. problem is, i also feel completely unlovable. my father, basically, told me that i was unlovable. i believe it. i've yet to find anyone who actually loves me. most people will use me and then discard me as though i mean nothing and am barely human. i'm just a walking vagina. a cum dumpster. a worthless abyss. i think it's important that you know i'm well - educated and come from a wealthy family on my mother's side, so i'm not exactly some poverty - struck dolt without any future at all. it's just that i feel like i have nothing to look forward to outside of a career and even that feels like it's too easy. everything i want career - wise, i'm able to get. i'm very good as hustling and i think charming the shit out of people is something that comes easily to those of us who were victims of childhood abuse. we have a tendency to be funny and very warm - hearted. i know in my case, it is because i am so desperate to hide from my problems and it is easy to do so when you're like - able. i doubt anything that i typed is cohesive or makes much sense, but if you look hard enough you'll see that i lack a self - identity, am riddled with fear of dying alone and miserable, and, quite frankly, have no idea how to function on a social level. i'm about to be 30 and would like to quit being so scared. i'm about to take a huge exam in july. i'm currently in prep. my instructor told a story about his father today. his father was in d - day and fought all the way through the battle of the bulge and was an amazing war hero. this same instructor told me, after i had to inform him of my ptsd after writing an essay on a rape victim who committed suicide as a result of the rape, that i was made of metal. i'm starting to realize that maybe i am a fucking fighter. if i can just figure out who the hell i am and quit feeling so lost as a result of all the denial and dissociative disorders that accompany my ptsd, i think i could really do some impressive shit with this life. it seems like such a simple task to, really, have 1 thing to rectify, but that 1 thing, an identity, is some multi - faceted and deeply rooted in complex issues, that it's going to be tough. i want to keep fighting, though. for a minute there, i wanted to kill myself, but after today, i realized that i'm fighting a war against what my father and his best friend did to me. if i win, it'll be a win for every little girl out there who goes through the same. i can't necessarily stop this from happening over and over and over, but i can at least come out of it as some beacon of hope to others. thanks in advance to any help that you can give me and i apologize if none of this makes sense, because i don't feel like proof - reading. & lt ; 3","v7ebx","","7","21","1339986790","","-0.0159323943662"
"survivorsofabuse","TheInsights8","writing about emotions eases inner stress and triggers trauma","hi guys, i'and ve seen tremendous improvements in clients who have used writing to deal with their trauma or anxiety and i wanted to share this with you. writing helps people to organize thoughts and give meaning to a traumatic experience. the process of writing enables us to learn to consistently better regulate our emotions. also writing about something fosters an intellectual process — the act of constructing a story about a traumatic event — that helps someone break free of the endless mental cycling more typical of brooding or rumination. in terms of human neuroscience, the act of privately expressing emotions that would help the emotions move from amygdala, a primitive part of brain tissue which we have little control of and causes repetitive thinking and rumination, to move to prefrontal cortex which is responsible for higher conceptual order thinking and understanding. also, when people open up privately about a traumatic event, they are more likely to talk with others about it — suggesting that writing strategies leads indirectly to reaching out for social support that can aid healing. timing also matters. a few studies have found that people who write about a traumatic event immediately after it occurs may actually feel worse after expressive writing, possibly because they already are not yet ready to face it. as such, it's suggested that clinicians and patients to wait at least one or two months after a traumatic event before trying this technique. here, i included a link that talks more directly about benefits of writing : https : / / www. youtube. com / watch? v = 3gyxrkhgzzs hope this is helpful.","2zh3ow","","2","0","1426691975","","0.0304625"

"survivorsofabuse","polly-esther","so how can i possibly process that new male male guilt? learned i am not getting the new only unwanted victim because well of avoiding my previous abuser.","i've shared my story before and at the time it was really helpful. things have changed quite dramatically since then and i'm struggling to process it all again so i thought i would have another try. i have reported my abuser to the police and have found it an amazing and positive experience so far. i am believed and have been supported by the officers in such a sensitive and honest way. being told by a police officer that they want to get him and will do everything they can to do so is an incredible feeling. so far he has been arrested and is on bail while the powers that be decide whether to charge him. such is the british judicial system, there is a lot of waiting involved. the main issue that's come from all of this other than putting my mother through learning the intimidate details of my abuse. is that it's been confirmed i am not his only victim. before he married my mum he had a previous wife, three daughters and a son. all three daughters went through a very similar experience to me. they reported when i was about 15 and i was questioned about an incident of indecent exposure by stepfather to me as a child. that event never happened and at the time i was still very much under his control though the abuse had stopped so i told the truth about the events i was asked about and chose to not say anything else. i hadn't realised then i was abused or anything like that and so thought it was the right thing to do. he wasn't charged and that they were lying became the consensus. since then it's been at the back of my mind but i've spent so long protecting myself and family from this i hid from it. it was safer for me to think it was only me. something about me made him do it and i was his only victim. with even an ounce of rational thought that argument is broken but it kept me safe for a long time. now it's gone. i'm safe now of course and i have so much support and love that i'm slowly dealing with this and can actually see my own progress. i expected set backs when i reported, i always knew it would make me flash back more and it would mean my mum would learn the details and my protecting her would be totally written over. i was prepared for them, i wasn't prepared for the monster i'd made my abuser to be an even worse one. i now question everything all over again, i am the reason he married my mum? he's a predator, who has there been since me? i've spent so much time and energy convincing myself that he did it only to me for some reason or another and it made it better. when i was the only one at least i was, well the only one. now i think i could have protected someone. it's all so much bigger than i thought. his daughters have been questioned and are willing to do whatever they need to in order to get charges pressed this time and i'm so grateful they will help. i feel so guilty they weren't believed before, i am dreading it if he doesn't get charges and for them it will be second time around. even their own mother didn't believe them i've since learned. all because of the manipulating creature my stepfather is. i really don't know how to process this and how to manage the guilt. guilt and shame are the buzz words of therapy and overcoming them has been my biggest triumph. it's changed my life to say it wasn't my fault but now this guilt feels more warranted and how can i not feel to blame for both not telling the police before and the fact i may have let another girl be abused.","2dt54u","","8","11","1408293639","","-0.013580952381"
"survivorsofabuse","throwawaykrickets","conflicting emotions and can't possibly get you over it","i've been having a real hard time these past few months. i was abused when i was 13, and have not spoken up about it until about a year ago. this was mostly due to conflicting emotions, something i'm still having a hard time dealing with. there are things that have happened pretty recently with my abuser that i haven't told anyone about either because of this. i'm not sure how to help myself, or if i can even be helped or fixed. i can't even think about what has happened to me without feeling dread ; my heart starts to beat faster, i feel like i can't breathe, i feel like i'm dying. i feel like i'm in a speeding car and that i'm headed straight for a brick wall and the brakes don't work. i have to stop thinking about it immediately or something bad will happen. i haven't told anyone about my abuse until now because of this constant battle in my head. in fact, i was debating on what had happened to me - - and what still was happening to me was abuse. i was physically abused by my brother, and that had a constant negative feeling to it. my relationship with him was not ( and still is not ) good, and it was straight and clear to me, even when it was happening. but my sexual abuse with another abuser feels... complicated. muddy water, in a sense. sometimes my father was sweet and gentle. he could be so sweet, how / why would he do certain things to me? i want to hate him so much for him for what he's done - - not just the sexual abuse he has done to me, but the emotional manipulation and pain he's put my family through for years. but i remember some of the sweet memories and presents, how could i hate him if he's done those terrible things? i had a hard time recognizing my abuse because of that back and forth, and even now i doubt myself. it all feels like a sick game of manipulation, but sometimes i'm worried it's just in my head. he would pick on me, belittle me sometimes. i wanted to be an actress or a singer when i was 13, he told me i wasn't nearly as pretty or talented enough. i'd wake up to him kissing me. i figured that was just him being daddy. i remember i begged my parents to let me get a lock on my door, and he pitched a fit about it, saying i didn't need one. threatened to take down my door if i ever locked it when he thought it wasn't justified. because of these things and my physical abuse from my brother and my insecurities, i began to sink into a depression. i made plans to kill myself. i wanted help. he denied it to me, probably from fear of what i had to say. when i did attend therapy for a brief time, he wanted to sit in on sessions. a year or so after that my mom kicked him out of the house, and i'm guessing he assumed it was because i told. before he left he came into my room and shut the door and said that i betrayed him. i had no idea what he was talking about because i hadn't said a word to mom. he tried to kill himself a day or so later. after that when he found his own place visits weren't so bad. he'd buy me whatever junk food i wanted. he basically played'cool dad '. he'd talk shit about my mother, made up lies about why they split up. but he let me do anything i wanted to while i was over there, he essentially treated me like an adult, even though i was just a teenage girl at this time. i liked this cool dad who bought me presents, it seemed like he cared. but i didn't like spending the night. he'd have me sleep in bed with him. even when he was seeing someone and they were over, he wanted me to sleep with him. i felt super uncomfortable and couldn't sleep at night because i could feel him press himself up against me. i feel bad because when we were over i'd make my little sister sleep next to him because i was too afraid. i remember one time while he was out i found creepy things in his google search results, mostly porn involving teenage or young girls. i know there are more negative memories, but if i think on them i get that panicked feeling, i beg myself to stop thinking about it. i try to normalize it in my head - - maybe i'm just over exaggerating? maybe this is how things are supposed to be? he played it off as normal, father / daughterness. besides, he could be so nice, those things couldn't have had bad intent? maybe i'm reading into it? maybe it's normal and i'm just weird i'm wrong i am being bad. there are days i recognize it was abuse and wrong but then i second guess myself, maybe i'm overreacting? i'm just sensitive. i'm stupid. everything he has said about me is true. he could be so nice and lavish me with presents. i felt like he cared. if he cared there is no way what he did was wrong. i don't know what's wrong with me or how to make these conflicting thoughts go away. do i need to feel validated somehow? is there a word for what's he done? why can't i just let myself think on what has happened and recognize it? even right now i feel that panicked, speed driving into a wall feeling. i just want to be past this i want this to be over. i want to be healthy and normal. i want to get over this but i can't because whenever i think about what has happened i quickly shut myself down. i don't know what to do and even as i write this i can feel myself breaking down. i'm so scared to even post this.","2zat9k","","5","8","1426554571","","-0.0976184210526"

"" our people will get more out of the idea of him, rather than the jellybean he really was. "" this is a ghost that victims of abuse have in them. "" conceal, don't feel. don't let them know.

"" they can't hold you back anymore. let it [ the secret ] go. and when they bombard you with explanations, proof, accusations, turn away and slam the door. don't care at all what they say, let the shitstorm rage on. the perfect lie is gone. the point is, here you stand in the light of day. you deserve to live in a world where people don't take advantage of you for their people own selfish selfish, spoiled needs. by coming out, letting it go, you are turning the burden on them to change. and that's why you will rise like the break of dawn. you will be free.","31xh91","","11","0","1428532748","","-0.103353125"
"survivorsofabuse","thefuchsiaisnow","survivor of child emotional trauma and youth sexual abuse abuse, published first post - in my christmas story","this is my first post here, so here is my story : my father was ( and is ) extremely emotionally abusive. he has no sense of boundaries himself, and doesn't respect the boundaries of other people, so there was some sexual abuse as well. i have sort of a long and storied mental health history, including being suicidal and institutionalized four times starting from age 15. it is only now though, at age 25, that i feel like i am really making progress. i have talked about the emotional abuse and was in therapy for it for years, but the sexual abuse was something i never talked about. when my therapist tried talking about it, i dropped out of therapy for several years. my current boyfriend encouraged me to go back and talk about it, and i am still working on that. it is still very hard for me to believe that what happened is considered sexual abuse, and i keep trying to convince myself that i interpreted things the wrong way and that my dad didn't really mean it, or that it wasn't as bad as all that. my therapist says it counts as sexual abuse, and so do things i've read in books and on the internet, so i am really struggling to come to terms with that. i have cut off contact with my father, which is something that i have struggled for years to do. it has been nearly three months since i told him not to contact me, and it is going well so far. i have been reading books and going to therapy and trying to think about things that i don't really want to think about, in an effort to get better. my current challenges are mostly related to "" sense of self. "" i have a very hard time thinking my own feelings and thoughts are valid, and i am not good at establishing boundaries with other people. it is really hard to get better when i am constantly telling myself that i am stupid for being upset about things, and that i am exaggerating and that other people would be able to deal with this better than me. but i know that i can't get better until i allow myself to acknowledge that i am hurt, and stop beating myself up for being hurt by things that i couldn't control. i am also struggling to work with the rest of my family ( mother and sister ) who were also emotionally ( and perhaps sexually ) abused by losing my father. in particular, my mother is now deeply in denial that she is still experiencing problems related to him. they separated ten years ago, but remained very much in contact, and she is clearly still recovering from a severely emotionally abusive relationship. the problem is that she is often very forgiving of my father and willing to rationalize or explain away his behavior. that was always the dynamic throughout my whole childhood, to the point where, now, i am struggling to understand how she didn't see the sexual abuse happening. i remember telling her about incidents with my father, and she remembers me telling her about them, but she still doesn't seem to really understand it on a deeper level. the response is just something like, "" oh, dad's just a creep, "" but there is no deep feeling or anger or anything. i want to be able to have a healthy relationship, and believe in myself enough to allow myself to have a happy life and a good job and to feel fulfilled by my choices, but i am constantly sabotaging myself. i feel like i don't deserve to be happy, and no matter what i do, it won't be good enough. i am trying to get my father's voice out of my head, but it is slow going. i know that the more i build my support network, particularly with people who "" understand, "" the easier it will be to break away from this. anyway, that is my long and rambly story. tl ; dr another girl with daddy issues. hi everyone! i would really like to hear from people who can relate to this experience, including covert and emotional incest, uncertainty about what "" counts "" as abuse, and things like that. thanks for reading!","1eqqro","","10","4","1369107232","","-0.146175609756"

"domesticviolence","dogmoonchicken","but can't he really seem ever to really find up any decent way back out...","i am 25. since i can remember ( 6 / 7 years old ) my parents have spent most weekends of the year getting very drunk and fighting. sometimes violent ( very violent ), always verbal and emotionally abusive to each other. when i was about 8, i decided that i had to protect my younger brother and sister ( especially my sister who was a baby ). i have seen so much pain. i have woken up to my mother strangling my father with her bare hands. i ran over and tried to stop her / him from fighting and was then held up against the wall by my mother as she screamed at me to stop being a little * * * * *. i have seen bruises, cuts, bloody feet where the floors were made from glass / cups / plates all shattered. every time this happened i would naturally protest, in vain for hours on end the next day. they would say that they would change and give up drinking. everything would continue on as normal, until the next weekend. when i was 18 i moved to college. it continued, with my brother trying to step in and help. i tried to come home every weekend and it was milder, but they still were drinking a lot. in my final year i could not come home as much, and it went back to the same awful level that it was at. after a few big interventions from myself. my dad was so afraid that i would have him locked up if he drank again, he did stop so much ( he is the violent one ) my mother is the sly, * * * * stirrer in the background who buys the alcohol, and winds him up until he pops. when my brother moved to college, it was only my mam, dad and sister ( 16yrs old ) at home. this was in 2012. from sept - dec everything seemed to be going to well. i didn't come home as much and it seemed to have died down. noone spoke of it. my brother and i came home at the weekends ( not every week ) and when we did it all seemed so nice. we came home for xmas 2012. again, everything seemed fine. we had christmas day / dinner specials etc and i did eventually feel like there was something strange going on. i realise that my own mam and sister were barely speaking to me dad. everything else did feel normal and i wasn't going to ask about the hostile vibe i was getting as i thought it could be me not being able to understand that things might actually be normal here now. my brother and i went out to meet friends the day after christmas in the local pub. my mam, dad and sister stayed at home and everything was fine when we left them. at about 12. 30am my brother got a call from my sister which he missed. at around 01 : 30am i went to find him to walk home with him and he mentioned this to me, at the time i thought it was a little strange / worrying but nothing too major that she would ring him. when i checked my phone walking home, she has text me asking "" are you coming home soon "". when we got back to the house everyone was in bed. we sat up talking for a while ( both after having a great night together ), then went to bed.... the next day changed everything for me. even after years of abuse, the events in the next few days after that night have ruined me since and had brought me to writing this here. i feel so unsteady, worried, worried that something will happen... the reason why my sister had rang that night and had text was because my dad was after drinking heavily since my brother and i had left. he was up shouting around the house saying that he would kill my mam and sister. ( this had been what was going on the last few months and i was so unaware of it ).... my then 16 year old sister had then went to the kitchen, and taken every single sharp knife that we had and brought them up to her room where she sat on the floor waiting for my dad to come up so that she could stab him. she had completely broken down from him. the next day, i stood in the kitchen beside my brother, both so so unaware of this hell that had been going on. we were told my my mam that she didn't want to ruin another xmas for us so didn't say anything about these events that were occuring all the time in the last few months. we were utterly shocked. i had been in this lovely bubble for the few days i was home thinking finally we were an ok kind of family. it was so wrong. i sorted out the whole mess, told my dad he could stay and i would go to the doctor with him for help with the alcohol abuse / antidepressants ( as he said that was the issue ). sorted out my sister and mam, brought them off for new years etc. my mam just smiled along and thanked me, telling me that she had finally realised that drink was now banned in "" this "" house and will never ever be seen around her again. told me that she was finally free of my dad and spoke of how she would give him two months to seek help and then ask him to leave the house. she told me she had no more love for him and they were over. she thanked me for sorting out the mess yet again...... as time went on my dad stayed in the house ( minus the drinking ) which was brilliant. one whole year passed where he never drank, my mother apparently didn't too. last year it all seemed to be looking up... however, i'm not stupid and for the last two years, i have been anxious, had nightmares, and have become a very different person. i live in constant fear that this will happen again. every few nights i have a dream about the abuse that i have witnessed in the past. i can't be happy. they just keep letting me down. i brought my sister to my house in the city this summer. she stayed from monday - friday and she got the bus home to them at the weekend. from the day she left, they started drinking again. by the last week ( week 3 ), she had been gone about 14 nights. they had built up so many bottles of wine that the dog house was full of bottles. it started again, i came home two weeks later ( about 2months ago now )... unannounced and found empty bottles everywhere. my sister confessed that they were up drinking around the house at night. she said to me that she did not want me to say anything because she couldn't cope with the drama / mess / fighting it would cause if i interveened again. i went home this weekend.... any time i go home at the weekend i stay at home if they go out to the pub. my best friend was having a birthday getogether and wanted me to come out too. my mam and brother begged me to come out and asked "" why would you not come, what is wrong with you? "". i kept saying no until my sister ( now 17 ) said that she would like to go out too for a little while ( not drinking ) and go home then. so i gave in and got ready. the start of the night was fine. i drank a lot more than i should. by the end of the night i was very drunk ( as too were my brother, mam and dad ) my brother's girlfriend - who i know and love was there. i went completely mad and started on her. calling her names and asking why she was always in our house. ( this is completely not me ) my dad freaked at me. then i freaked at him. i started yelling all the things he had ever done to us in the pub on front of a few other people. we went home and the yelling continued. my sister was asleep at this stage. i kept going, keep yelling and shouting at him and my mam ( i was so crazy with drink ). my brother was trying to calm the situation. i ( in my drunken state, wanted my brother to be angry at them too ) and so i told him something awful that my parents had done when we were younger. my brother flipped and broke mirrors, ornaments in the house. i then called the cops... ( in all the history of abuse in my house, i never had the balls to do that, so it is considered very bad to my parents and sister that i would do that ) they came,. and did nothing much... i went to my room and slept for 3 hours. i woke up, my dad had woke the whole house and was up shouting about me and what i had done. i grabbed my things ( called my boyfriend ) and we went back to my flat in the city ( about 2 1 / 2 hours drive ) my mam rang me about 30mins later saying that i was mad / everything was my fault / never talk to them again. i text my sister and apologised and asked her to send me one message so i knew she was okay but she has not replied... my boyfriend told me not to worry ( he hates them for everything they have done ) and my brother has pretty much continued with his week. i am sitting here, not knowing what to do. the only person i care about is my sister, and she hates me now? they have framed me, called me crazy and will now probably continue with their drinking... as it doesn't seem as bad as what i did the other night..... i really haven't got anyone to talk to. i hate my family, but did not need to bring this on them. if i was worried about the recent evidence of drinking i should have confronted them again. but it didn't. it's all such a mess. i cannot continue with my life right now... tldr : got really drunk and called the cops on my abusive parents ( but was uncalled for at this time ). parents think i'm scum for doing this and sister thinks i'm crazy and won't talk to me.","2kocc7","","5","1","1414591797","[new]","-0.0833428571429"

( professional counselor, former victim, police officer, etc. ) do you think this is a good idea? does it already exist? any other input is much appreciated! i have midterms and projects due for the next few weeks but if i get enough positive feedback on the idea i'll throw together a prototype in early november.","2jan27","","3","6","1413353546","[new]","0.0560433333333"

"" my mom believed that parents should present a "" united front "" and never defended us in any way. he did not abuse her and i never saw them fight, so when he left her when i was 12 it came as a total shock. mostly i felt guilty because i was glad my dad was gone, while my mom was falling apart. from age 8 to age 11, i was sexually abused by my oldest brother. when i was 13, i was forced to tell my mother after having told a mandated reporter. she didn't believe me and accused me of "" leading him on "", but she made me agree to deny it if the abuse was reported. it wasn't reported, because the mandated reporter was told that cps would get a wall of denial from my family. by that time, my brother was dating a 12 - year - old, who he impregnated and married when she was 15 ( that was allowed at the time in the state where i grew up ). in some ways my mother was abusive, too. she had a huge closetful of clothes, but i was only allowed to have three shirts, a dress, and two pairs of pants ( and they could not be black, because i was a goth as a teenager and she didn't like that ). i was allowed one pair of nylons a month ( 1980s, american south, nylons were "" necessary "" ). one of my most vivid memories was of her attacking me and leaving handprints on my thighs that lasted for days, because i said "" shit "" after getting a runner in my nylons. i was 14. she also always humiliated me for my weight. she was a yo - yo dieter all her life ( which may have led to her death ) and even paid for me to be forcibly put on [ fen - phen ] ( http : / / en. wikipedia. org / wiki / fenfluramine / phentermine ), which could almost have killed me. i just found out last year why my pedophile brother ( who went on to sexually abuse his own daughters ) was defended by my mom even after multiple prison terms. he was sexually abused by a teenage babysitter when he was two years old, and my parents made a vow that they would deal with all the fallout from that, no matter what. that included drug abuse and pedophilia. but the last time he got out of prison, she bought him a new car and let her move in with her. as i said. she died last night. i've only talked to her three or four times in the last decade. the last time was about a month ago. i reminded her of the sexual abuse and asked how she could forgive his multiple felony prison terms ( she talked a bit about having been arrested herself for not paying a traffic ticket, as if that excused his convictions for things like manufacture of methamphetamine ). she said that he was "" all she had "", even though he literally drove me out of town at gunpoint, after which i moved 5, 000 miles away. she knew about this when it happened. i don't know how to mourn. she's my mom. i remember everything about her, how she sounded, the smell of her perfume, how she moved. now she's in a refrigerated drawer in a morgue. and she's still my mom. i can't believe that we can't reconcile. i can't believe that i cannot ever call her. i just can't believe it ended this way. i'm not sure what my point is in posting this. i just needed to get it out and i have no other way of doing so, i guess. if you bothered to read it all, i thank you.","2pdh4b","","5","5","1418663413","","-0.222961702128"

"survivorsofabuse","drowningsyndrome","abusive double ex made telephone contact for the first time not in its almost 20yrs.","deep breath. feeling horribly out of control today. my abusive ex has attempted to facebook friend me which sounds stupid to even cause an anxiety attack. this is the first contact of any kind that we have had in about 15 years. i have not even seen him in person for 18 years. i have no one i can really talk to about this. i no longer have close friends and i don't want to bring this up with my husband. i'm afraid either he won't understand or he will judge me. i'm so tired of carrying this horrible weight on my own. i want help. i wish i could afford therapy or had some close friend i could confide in. i feel like it's a poison in me that won't run it's course. it's just rotting me away from the inside. i suffered abuse before i met him and it made it easy for him to take over my life. alienate me from everyone i knew back then and now i feel just as horrible as i did when i was sitting alone in our apartment with the realization that one day he would either kill me or i would kill myself to escape. it's funny how simple something like a facebook request can bring back the fear, the anxiety, the overwhelming dread. my hands are shaking and i want to curl up and hide. i used to feel like i wasn't angry at him. he himself was horribly abused and mistreated growing up. i felt like he too was a victim. he was of course, but what he did to me was not right. we had a fairly significant age difference and he should have known better. i think he did anyway, but ignored it so he could use me as his crutch. i wish i could go back to not being angry. to that numb place where it didn't hurt and i just accepted what happened as a fact of my past instead of the most horrible time in my life. the further i pushed those things away from my thoughts, the more often they would sneak into my subconscious, into my dreams, and ruin my every day relationships. i'm terrified to go to bed tonight. i know that i'm going to have a night terror. they've been getting worse over the years. instead of just yelling in my sleep, i have on two occasions now sleep walked, screamed and thrashed and actually seen things that are not there with my waking eyes. i got a medical cannabis card, and have been using marijuana to help relax and it works to an extent. it seems to ease my physical symptoms. nausea & amp ; headaches are common, and my shaking hands which i treat using the marijuana. i used to drink myself to sleep, years ago, but now i have no tolerance for alcohol which is probably a good thing. the fact that it makes me sick as hell is a good deterrent because i think it's far worse for my body than marijuana. i cannot obviously be high all the time though, i have a life and things to do and so i can only use it once the day is pretty much over. usually this is a good thing because at night the whole day comes rushing at my mind and i can use it to slow myself down. right now it's the middle of the afternoon and i'm struggling hard to even think straight. i don't know why seeing his stupid face threw me so hard. his name bolded in text on my screen beside his smiling profile picture. it makes me want to vomit. i'm so angry. it's not fair that my abusers are out living their lives without a care in the world and i'm here stuck in the hell inside my head and i can't get out. i'm now as physically sick on the outside as i feel on the inside and i see no light at the end of this tunnel. i am not in anyway suicidal. i'm just so tired of doing this alone. i'm posting this here because i have been reading this subreddit and related subreddits for some time and i feel like somebody would at least understand. even if you have nothing to say to me, and you read this far. thank you.","30azrb","","11","2","1427322185","","-0.110198113208"
"survivorsofabuse","Wren203","need some goddamn help","recently my mother and i have come to terms about the physical and mental abuse my father has put us through ( my mother went through this with her father as well ). we can't really turn to our friends about this, but i am hoping we can get some insight from others who may have experienced this abuse as well. from at the age of 2 to about the age of 12, i used to avoid my dad as much as possible. the reason was that if i questioned anything, did something different he didn't like, or just happened to be around when he was mad at something else, i used to get yelled at or sometimes have the crap beaten out of me with a belt or his bare hands. a strong memory of the time was when i was age 3 and refused to eat some rice, he proceeded to beat me till i puked a little rice up. another was when i was 10, i forgot the reason why he did this but to avoid anyone hearing what was happening he hoisted me by the neck against the wall and then proceeded to yell at me. i have that much constant fear of him to this day. when i turned 13 was when the majority of the physical abuse stopped and the mental abuse ramped up. i am a bright student and i was so back together then, but whenever i would do something good he'd respond with some dumbass story of his childhood, tell me how stupid i am, and that i'm retarded. he'd diminish everything i did, never once giving me credit for more than 2 minutes. god forbid he say he only was proud of me in front walls of people. if i tried to interact with him, within 3 minutes of he would release a flurry of curse words and insults in my direction. believe it or not, he was the only one who ever called me those names and cruel insults. i'm 23 now, in the past week my mother and i have shared out experiences about my dad with each other. she has endured such abuse from her father and my father for the past 40 years. we agreed to act as a team, but i don't know how to heal what was done to me and my mother. i don't want to carry this on with my family when i have another one, and i refuse to repeat this cycle with anyone. i was hoping someone could help me out.","1ic0a5","","1","2","1373887163","","-0.165954166667"

"survivorsofabuse","abusedthroaway","help me move in on? { wall painted of blank text }","so, i need your help. my whole life, i have been overweight. i am pretty, yes, but i have terrible self - esteem and it has always been this way. i have seen many therapists and eventually got to an equilibrium about it. i got my degree in theatre in 2007, and after college i moved to minnesota to take a job in college student housing. i knew no one there and was not even remotely prepared for what i had gotten myself into, so i moved back home in may of 2008. i met a boy and fell absolutely head over heels in love with him. i spent all my time wanting to be with him to the point that i threw my career away and started working part time gigs ( i suppose the fact that the economy crashed didn ’ t help either ). i finally found a full - time position working in a customer service call center for sprint. i started in october 2009 and continued following this man around even though he cheated on me and told me all the time i was shit and he didn ’ t love me, even though i knew he did. i became friends with his friends and was all but living in his apartment. then in june of 2009 i got diagnosed with cervical dysplasia, which is basically as close to cervical cancer as you can get without having actual cancer. there are three stages and after treatment and biopsy it was found i had stage three. i ended up having to have surgery to have part of cervix removed, so i would not actually get cancer and lose hope of ever reproducing ( heavy shit for a 25 year old ). tests came back negative after surgery. everything is hunky dory. continued shitty job and shitty relationship going deeper and deeper into a deep - seated depression. believing a little bit less in myself every day. pre - cancer returned. pre - cancer went away. got into some lesser drugs, but drugs none the same. then, in february of 2011, my boyfriend ’ s roommate who was also my very very good friend at the time got popped doing apparently a drug deal. she and her fiance have a 4 - year - old son. she ends up getting sentenced to six months in rehab. her fiance asks me to move in while she is away to help with the kid and the finances as he is going to have to quit his very high paying job, since he works out of town. i agreed even though i knew my relationship was slowly killing and that my boyfriend was seeing another woman on the side and not even hiding it from me anymore. i just agreed because he had chipped away at my self - esteem for so long that i honestly believed he could not be monogamous and it was the best i would ever get. anyway, i moved in. then, in march, i quit smoking. and that ’ s what changed everything. when i quit smoking i quit doing drugs because i felt so healthy i didn ’ t want to tarnish that. i began to see things through new eyes. all i did all the time was take care of this four - year - old little boy. the men in the apartment mostly ignored me. they would go out and party and have a good time and leave me to cook and clean and take care of the kid. in june, two days after my 26th birthday, i got fired from my job for doing something stupid. luckily, i registered with a temp agency and they got me the job i have now less than a week later. it doesn ’ t pay well but i like it a lot more and i am infinitely happier. i actually get to use my brain and i never go home sobbing like i did before. i thought everything was great. i had a new job. i was finally living with the man i loved. i had friends. in august, i was mailing my friend the letters her fiance and i written her. i ( like an idiot ) read his letter. i knew i wasn ’ t supposed to, but what can i say i ’ m a curious person. ( i still kick myself for this. ) in the letter it stated, "" [ name ] has got to go. she drives us all crazy and we hate her, but she serves a purpose and we need her for [ thekid ]. when you get home we will just get rid of her. "" i was crushed. absolutely broken hearted. i went to my parent ’ s house after work that day and they convinced me i needed to move home. i told them i was just going to stay at their house for a week to figure out what i wanted to do. i drove home, and, there, in the kitchen, was my boyfriend and his best friend / our roommate ’ s brother. they asked me what was wrong and i told them i was going to stay at my parent ’ s house for the week. the best friend, let ’ s call him j, who did not live with us, asked who was going to take of the kid for that week. i told j i did not know, and as i wasn ’ t his mother i was sure the three of them could figure it out. j then flew off the handle. he followed me around the apartment telling me if i was going to do that then i better pack my shit and go right now cause the only reason i lived there was to take care of the kid and if i wasn ’ t going to do that then i better get my bitch ass out. he told me he wasn ’ t kidding and i better start packing my shit. he called me every name under the sun. my boyfriend did nothing to stop him. he just watched as this man treated me like shit on shits shoes. eventually, j left and took the kid and my boyfriend with him. the next day, i was afraid i would go home after work and find my things in the yard. that ’ s when i knew i had to move. the confrontation was wednesday. by noon on saturday, everything i owned was at my parent ’ s house. since then, i ’ m waking up from this bad dream of emotional abuse and absolute misery. for a while, every day, i would realize something else about myself i lost. there are days i am crippled with guilt about my past and days i am overjoyed with the idea of beginning anew. i spent three years being told over and over again how much i suck and how ugly i am. i spent three years believing things that are not and never will be true. i lost my boyfriend of three years and all of my friends other than my sister. i had to find my way back to normal. so i joined a church, even though i ’ m not really a christian, and i auditioned for some plays. and i am exercising and dieting. i figured if everything has come crashing down then i might as well build it back up the way i want to. it doesn ’ t have to be the way it was before. i have done a really good job! i have made some great friends. i love being in the theater. i have lost almost 40 pounds. i feel amazing. i believe in my future. but it ’ s still there lingering in the back of my mind. well, recently, i started talking to this guy on reddit. he is awesome. we started out just being friends, but we both knew there was something more there. we both live in the same state just 5 hours away from each other. well, this weekend, he came to visit. we had the best 24 hours ever. i was so sad when he went home. we both agreed to go slow and not jump into some crazy commitment because the distance is crazy. but we talk every day. he is the last person i talk to before i go to sleep and we send each other texts first thing in the morning. he conspired with my friend to get my flowers for valentine ’ s day. he ’ s great. but i ’ m freaking out. i worry that he doesn ’ t want me. i worry he ’ s not interested. i worry it ’ s all a lie. i worry that he is just going to stop talking to me with no warning. i worry that i ’ m needy and its pushing him away. i worry i ’ m being manipulated. i worry there is something he isn ’ t telling me. i know he can tell something has been bothering me lately because all of my conversations with him are carefully calculated and not as carefree as they were before. i know it all has to do with being manipulated for so long that i can ’ t trust and just let it be. how do i move past all of this? tl ; dr : a lot of bad stuff happened, and was emotionally abused. how do i move on and trust my budding relationship?","ppl3y","","2","1","1329251424","","0.00303223140496"

"survivorsofabuse","polly-esther","been struggling to find a firm place in my head to process everything, now thought somehow this might help help. pretty long old story.","i really don't know how to write this but after reading other peoples stories it's given me some courage to try. my story is pretty average and pretty strange, i think that's how everyone feels about their abuse and the circus that surrounds it. i was sexually abused by my step father from the age of 6 until my mid teens. a lot of memory suppression means i don't have an exact time line but well the ball parks enough. i was made to feel very special and loved, with the abuse starting from a medical reason for him to touch me to a routine whenever my mum wasn't around. i was spoilt into to silence and being a pragmatic child whose self preservation kicked in, i went along with it all and let the cycle carry on. as i got to the age where i was more independent and spending more time with my friends it stopped though the gifts and spoiling continued so i carried on with my life like nothing happened. then when a year before i went to university he had an affair and sent my whole family into a tail spin. him and my mum reconciled but he never moved back in. over the next ten years he would just visit my mum and brother whenever he felt like gracing them with his presence. it destroyed my mums relationships with he brother and mum because they didn't want her to take him back. due to my mums own shame issues stemming from her spilt with my real dad she's tried to just keep everyone happy and sacrificed her own to keep it all together. back to my story, i left for uni and so began the hard part. being away from home for the first time and having all the freedom in the world meant that the realisation of what happened to me come crashing down around me and i spiralled into a few years of destructive drinking and promiscuity. after realising that i was in fact abused, the horror of what would happen if anyone knew ate me alive. protecting my mum and brother from ever knowing how much of a monster he really is became my life's mission. i was prepared to martyr myself and sanity to make sure they never found out. i've gone months without speaking to my family because i can't bear and made myself out to be a selfish, thoughtless person who just looks out for herself. it was far from the case though, i'm suddenly incredibly lucky to have found my soulmate someone who was willing to help me keep my secret even though he paid the price for the way it made me behave. he understood why i had to keep it secret and has to this day been the only person who really understands how damaged i am by this. to the outside world, i'm a bit odd maybe a bit histrionic at times but nothing about screams what i've been through and so to meet me and know me finding out is a massive shock. so after a pretty self destructive few years i settled down with my partner and started to build a life together. we make each other truly happy and complete but the depression and anxiety i have has meant it's not always been easy and i have more bad days than good. still i was resigned to never breathing a word to anyone else. everytime my stepfather was thoughtless or controlling or just generally keeping my mum in a miserable half life i would get so angry and want to tell but the sheer idea would send me into hysterics, so i would cry it out and get on with things. then just over a year ago at my stepbrothers birthday, after a few too many wines i had words with my dad. my relationship with my dad is nice but blighted by his failings coupled with some abandonment issues ( my daddy issues are something else ) so him assuming drugs were the cause for my irrational behaviour over the years, fuelled by alcohol i blurted it all out. and he was amazing, he has done everything i wanted since that second, he kept my secret for me. my stepmother and uncle also found out that night but all they have done is be there for me. once they understood why i am the way i am they've forgiven me and i think it helps them. so on i went with the added strength of having my dad in my corner i was once again able to resume my secret keeping. until april last year, my grandmother wanted to take us on holiday, my mum, brother, me and my boyfriend. of course after the affair my stepfather wouldn't be coming. we went to to turkey for an all inclusive holiday and proceeded to have a great time. the third night came along and we were all drinking a lot, grandma went to bed and the rest of us had a dance at the disco. drunk is the only word for us. then all hell broke loose, i can't remember how or why but it all came out that night. there were hysterics and a fight between my brother and boyfriend, security and screaming but by the next day my life had blown apart. my boyfriend told my brother that's that main thing and it went from there. we then had four days left to digest and then we went home. i contacted my stepfather and told him to leave us alone and other than financial texts with my mum we have had no contact. i'm now in therapy and working towards being able to go to the police. i also have to be the rock in my family like i have been since the affair. the thing is it's nearly a year later and i'm crumbling, all the memories i suppressed are flooding me and everything is a trigger. operation yew tree really doesn't help. and i resent my boyfriend for taking my choice away. i'm happy they know it's amazing to be honest, no one of a second doubted me, other than my mum for about the first hour of shock. but where do i go from here, i see someone once a a week and after 6 months plus i can't say what he did to me in any detail. at the time it was happening it wasn't a frightening time, i didn't live in fear or feel horrible or dirty, i just didn't feel anything. we did it and went back to life and then i get bought something or be allowed to do something i wouldn't ordinarily. i did feel like i was benefiting, i really didn't feel anything just that no one could know. it's only now that i'm free to think and free of the shackles of the secret can i truly see what he did. i realised at 18 i was abused but it's taken until now for me to understand the magnitude of it. and i've always just gone on, i have all the hang ups and self loathing. the angry defensive passive aggressive hate filled side. i've tried to destroy myself, i've done a good job of screwing up some perfectly lovely men and i can't remember what it feels like to not feel alone. my counsellor has helped me see that despite my also histrionic emotions i never let myself feel anything. i blanket it all with a reason that's accessible, i can be more upset about my boyfriend playing cricket than i can be about this. i've written all this down and i don't even know why now, i just really want to hear from people who know exactly how i feel and it's really hard to find them. i wish there was an aa for survivors so you can just go and share with people who get exactly where you've been. i can't handle the idea of people thinking of be being abused, at the moment my flashbacks are like i'm walking in and watching and seeing for the first time how truly bad that was rather than the indifference and compliance i felt back then. i just really don't know how to move forward from here, my goal is the police but i feel at an impasse. thanks for reading, i've never shared like this before and just the writing is

( which needless to say provided quite the opposite result ) i don't expect anything sexual. she has not seen him since the divorce, even moved to a diffrent country. this day is quite a few years in the past. - mother was not really abusive ( according to her ), but really not a tough love kind of person. focussing a lot on her daughters schoolwork, but forgetting there's more to a kid than school. she missed birthdays and high school graduation. perhaps she is suffering under this past. problems include, but are not limited to : - insomnia - nightmares - difficulty to process emotions - trust issues. - very hesitant to almost every form of touch with anybody. - not wanting to have children, simply for fearing she might abuse them. - very low self esteem. - saying about herself that she's a bad person. i would love to help her in any way shape or form, but i do not know what to do. she herself wants to ignore it, bury it, and is not open to any other options. however, seeing as she is clearly struggling, i would do anything to help her cope. genuine and honest compliments do not seem to get through to her in any way, and i'm not able to convince her that she's a good looking person. what are the do's and don't of this situation? what can i do to try and help her, and what should i definetly not do.","2idej8","","3","5","1412531308","","0.0161407407407"

( the x - nine posted by me from number 2x )","ok, so first off, i know he's abusive and i need to get out ( took me a while to get to that point! ), but i feel completely trapped. * * a bit of backstory : * * my boyfriend and i live together with his 12 year old son and our 6 month old baby. we both worked full time until the baby was born, now i'm a sahm and will be for another 6 months, as i'm canadian and we get a full year of maternity leave at about 50 % pay plus tax credits. i can work ( and i do work about 16 hours a week ) but only up to a certain amount before they start deducting my mat leave pay, so it isn't worth it for me to work more due to the cost of childcare. i only have a high school diploma at the moment, so my options are limited career - wise, but i plan to go back to school next fall to be an rn and i'm working on upgrading some of my sciencey high school courses in the meantime. * * ok, so that's us. now what's going on : * * when i was pregnant he tried to force me to get an abortion, but i refused because that's just not a choice i was comfortable making in my situation ( nothing against it as an option for anyone else ), and he started to treat me really poorly as a result. he'd have these huge sudden blowups over tiny things ( and things that didn't bother him before or haven't bothered him since ) and scream in my face for hours, and slam objects against tables and walls. several times while yelling at me he's "" casually "" picked up a knife or large object like a table leg and waved it for emphasis. not at me or right in my face, he's never directly threatened me with a weapon, but i'm not stupid, that's obviously intended to be an intimidation tactic. his blowups usually pass quickly, and he immediately acts like they never happened. last fall, after his biggest blowup yet, i filed a police report and applied for an emergency protection order. it was denied ( and the judge slut shamed me for being pregnant and unmarried and told me that "" this sort of thing occasionally happens "" in bad relationships, and it doesn't mean there's any abuse going on ) and it totally crushed me. my two friends who went with me for all of this took control of the situation and told me i had to leave, and took me home and started moving my stuff. i know they meant well, but they just came in and took control and didn't let me have a say, and it made me feel even shittier, so i went back the next day. they haven't spoken to me since, and i don't blame them. : ( throughout my pregnancy, he would constantly tell me that he wouldn't love our child, that he would never change a diaper or help out at all, that he hoped i had a miscarriage, that he'd deny paternity and try to get his parental rights waived, and he'd ask me if i regretted not having an abortion, to which he'd get unbelievably angry regardless of my answer. he also told me that he wanted to push me down the stairs, and that i'd better call my mother to come collect my body. this all seemed to change ( briefly ) after the baby was born, but he remains completely unhelpful with the baby and i don't feel comfortable leaving the baby with him ( obviously! ) so i'm pretty drained from having no breaks ever. his new threat is that he'll fight for full custody of the baby and win. i tried to file another report in february, when he screamed at me for not being racist enough and chased me up the stairs ( all while i was holding the baby! ) to pound on the walls and scream at me more. but i got so upset and the police officer was impatient with me, so i decided to go home and calm down and try again later. i never went back. there have also been numerous instances of him abusing and threatening to abuse my dog. when he's angry at me, he'll talk about taking her while i'm out and throwing her out the side of the truck, or leaving the gate open, or kicking her face in, and he'll punctuate this by grabbing her by the throat and lifting or shaking her. phew. so that's where we're at now. last night i found evidence that he's been cheating on me as well, which doesn't really hurt at all as i've completely checked out emotionally, but for some reason it feels like a last straw in terms of staying with him. so i want, no, need to leave, obviously. but there are a couple of barriers, and that's what i would really love help with. * i don't have any money. i don't have much income right now since i'm on maternity leave, and i never made a whole lot of money to begin with, nor do i have the ability to find a better paying job right now. he insists on having access to my debit card and pin, and he always finds "" reasons "" to drain my bank account. if i complain or try to tell him no, he tries to tell me that it's really important, and if i don't buy it, he just threatens me and my dog. so about a month ago i opened a secret savings account and i've been siphoning off a little bit of my money, but it's hard because he keeps track of my income and blows up at me for being stupid and irresponsible if i tell him i've spent money on something he deems frivolous. * this sounds stupid, but i don't want to leave my stuff. i left an abusive relationship when i was 18, and i moved out with only my dog and the amount of stuff that i could carry. i have no regrets about leaving, but i do wish that i'd been able to save some things - my expensive kitchen equipment, my vintage clothes, some family heirlooms and pictures, etc. in our house now, i've brought almost everything into this relationship. i have nice dishes and cutlery, a nice dining room table and kitchen table and coffee table ( and lots of beautiful vintage tablecloths ), i've gradually replaced all of my expensive kitchen equipment, i have 5 large bookshelves full of books, i have numerous musical instruments, and i have several chairs that are family heirlooms. not exactly the kind of stuff that i can just pack into the diaper bag and zip out with in the middle of the night. * i'm worried about my boyfriend's older kid. when we got together he had his son every second weekend, and that was their custody agreement since the kid was a baby. but the kid's mom remarried about a year ago and the kid hates his stepfather, so he asked to move in with us full time. ( the fun weekend dad always wins! ) so now we have full custody of him, and he visits his mom every second weekend. to be perfectly honest, i don't really like the kid all that much, but i try very hard not to show it because i know that pretty much all of his issues are due to his shitty parents and it's not his fault. his mother works a lot and parties all the time, so he's been left home on his own a lot since he was very young, and his father ( bf ) has a strict parenting policy that "" having kids is not allowed to interfere with [ his ] life at all. "" so he goes out drinking and partying all the time, and doesn't even come home some nights, and that's just supposed to be ok. i've been here since before the kid moved in, so i make sure that he eats a healthy dinner and gets his homework done and goes to bed at a reasonable hour, and i talk to him about his day and play magic cards with him. it's heartbreaking how much he talks about missing his dad, and it makes me so angry that this kid has no one consistent in his life. and it makes me scared to leave, because if i go then he'll be back to having no one. he'll either continue living with his dad and start making his own meals and doing whatever he wants whenever he wants, or he'll move back in with his mom and be completely ignored there too. at 12 he doesn't need constant supervision, but i can see he's starting to develop problems - his reading is at a 3rd grade level, he was bullying other kids at school, and he lies all the time. i can't see that getting any better without parental involvement. * the dog. the only thing i love more than my dog is my son, and maybe my parents. maybe. she's been the only constant in my life for the last 7 years, and she's my rock. i love her to bits. i know i should find her a new home, if only to protect her from bf, but i'm selfish and i want her with me. i can't go to a women's shelter with her, and it's difficult though not impossible to find apartments that allow dogs. i though about finding her a temporary foster home, but i worry that seeing her gone would make bf suspicious, which i think might lead to physical violence. ideally, i want to leave quickly so that there's no time for him to try to hurt me. * custody. i don't feel safe leaving my son with him alone. the other day, i asked bf to hold the baby while i got dinner out of the oven, and he was a little fussy. instead of rocking him or holding him or talking to him gently, bf almost immediately put him down ( roughly, i think - i didn't see, but the way the baby started screaming suddenly makes me think that it was rough ) and yelled at him to "" shut the fuck up you little asshole. "" then he got up, and stormed out the door to have a cigarette, saying, "" i can't deal with this shit right now. "" this isn't the first time he's yelled at the baby for being fussy, it seems to be his way of dealing with him. i can't see this improving, and i don't want my son to be the victim of bf's bullying, especially when he's older and more able to understand. just the other day bf lost his shit at his older son and called him a "" fucking asshole "" and a "" crybaby faggot "" while threatening to beat him. so i think it's obvious why i do not want him to have even visitation rights. oh and i almost forgot to mention, he has several assault charges on his record ( found out about that when i filed the report last fall ) and he does cocaine occasionally ( that i know of - could be more ) which i think is a big contributing factor to his sudden blinding rages. so i'm hoping that will help my case when i fight for custody, although i'm not sure if i can prove the cocaine use. alright. that felt good to get off my chest, and cookies for you if you read all of that! * * so wtf do i do next? * *","uhdu2","","10","6","1338658355","","-0.0826226415094"

"domesticviolence","bookworm1980","understanding the cycle of violence","part two i'll start this now. because i'm still awake and my bruised back hurts and i can't get comfortable, because my bf is at work til 8 am and because i still have battery life. we'll see how far i get. i left off basically at the age of about 5, kindergarten, when my mom, after years of abuse, left my dad because he asked permission to cheat on her with a co worker. my dad was apparently a pretty cunning abuser. his'women'never left him until he had already moved on to the next. anyway.... i think that has a place later in my story. so, my mom divorced my dad. finally! it was maybe quieter around the house, but not easier. back then they didn't have such strict laws about child support. dad rarely paid anything. if he did it was sporadic and not what we should have been given. an example.... my dad had full benefits for us thru mcdonald douglas when we were kids, but we only ever got to the dentist twice, as needed for school, my entire childhood. i was a jr in h. s. before i got my 3rd visit. thankfully both mine and my brother's teeth came in pretty straight, and i inherited my dad's strong teeth so i've never had many cavities. i do have periodontal disease, but there's nothing i can do about that right now. anyway.... lol. dad's new'girlfriend'was on coke. he was already a violent alcoholic. he started doing coke. his girlfriend had two boys, who she only had custody of every other weekend like my dad had us. they would have us all together so their other weekends they could do whatever they did. both her boys were slightly older then me. one by a year maybe and the other by maybe 3. both boys were also very violent, angry, mean and abusive themselves. the older one more so. shawn and shane. shawn, the eldest, more so and often directed at my poor little brother. i would try to protect him. shawn was the first male to actually abuse me at age 5 or 6. one of the first times we were all together was in my dad's new apartment he said he was playing a game with me, he handcuffed me to the post of my dad's apartment stairwell said they were gonna do something and come back. i was like 5 or 6. i was just happy to be included in the boys game. if you read my first post, i was mostly left with older boys for babysitting... i didn't really have any reason not to trust them. i knew some boys were nicer then others, but i'd never been hurt before. so, he cuffed me to the outside hall stairwell of an apartment building and all the boys left. it went from afternoon to evening to night. i cried, i screamed, i peed myself, neighbors - grown people - walked right by me into their apartments ( this happened in st. charles, mo ). finally, my dad's girlfriend, figured out while handing the kids mac n cheese, that they were missing a kid. my dad was too high / drunk to know i was gone. once freed, i came up and locked myself in the bathroom ; ashamed, embarrassed cause the boys made fun of my wet pants when i walked in, tired, hungry, crying, feeling unloved and invisible.... until my dad damn near broke the bathroom door down when i wouldn't open it... because he needed to pee. he didn't do it to check on me, he was just angry i wouldn't let him in the door. i think connie ( his gf ) might have gotten beat up that night while we all laid a door away. hard to tell tho cause it also sounded like they had sex. damn drugs. those boys were mean. they used to get sport out of kneeing my 3 yr old brother in the balls. shawn taught shane how to grab me by the hair and throw me down. shawn said he'd take me on a bike ride and show me the neighborhood and then rode away faster then i could follow and lost me. i never did know their address. i was left in a pouring rainstorm and gave up in front of someone's house. a woman came out, found me sobbing, and idk how she got me home. even the car ride seemed to take 10 mins, which was probably 3 in adult time, but i had no clue where i lived there. just up some giant hill, and like a left and 2 rights into a subdivision cul de sac. when i got back i played jacks and then shawn taught me chess. i hated those boys, but we were also survivors together. they took out their hatred at us for dad beating their mom. they did abuse us. but we also leaned on eachother. i think maybe that's when i first learned love and hate can be the same. one time it was a really bad fight between their mom and our dad and some people across the cul de sac took us in and called the cops. dad was sooooooo mad at me. but like i said, other then the belt thing, he never did hit me. or one weekend when both connie and dad were soooo messed up on coke or heroin or crack, no food in the house and like 12 inches of snow, me and shawn walked idk how far through people's yards and whatever to get to iga to buy groceries to feed us kids and back, with stolen money and a wagon. idk if you have read the prior post and will read any others, but my dad died when i was 9, so we were pretty desperate. i might have been 8 on that little snow excursion to the grocery store. or even shortly before my dad died, all of us being locked in the basement with no food, water, way to go to the bathroom, get out, covers, never knowing if they would even remember locking us down there. so, yeah, those boys sucked, they hurt me and my brother, they probably hurt a lot also, but we also did at times have to help eachother just to get through a weekend. idk. maybe that's when i became messed up. i do know i became mean and embarrassed during that time. i only have snippets of memory... but one of my g. s.'s husbands... i think i was molested. i remember enough to think i was, and to suspect my grandma suspected, and to think once she did he moved on to my brother, but not many specifics. i won't go into that tonight tho. and that one's hard, cause although i remember a lot from a young age about a year i have mostly blocked out. 5 to 9 yrs of age life sucked. that was life two weekends a month for like 4 years at dads. he made it almost worse at home. i'll have to continue this tho cause it is getting late and now my battery is almost dead. if you are reading tho.... thank you.","2fzvmo","","5","1","1410348055","[new]","-0.13977311828"

"survivorsofabuse","Lucy_Smith","adult sexual abuse support","i've wanted to write this for a while, but i've never felt stable enough. today i've finally written it, and i want to share it here in the hope it might help someone... ( worth noting, i am in the uk ) sexual abuse is arguably one of the most damaging things a person can do to another. you are left with lifelong scars that no one else can see, and sometimes you are left to suffer in silence. it makes you question who you are, and who you trust. i spent many years of my childhood being sexually abused, and kept it quiet for a long time. in fact i didn ’ t ever tell anyone, my mother found out by looking through my phone. initially i was abused by a family member, which i think left me very suggestible and needing to be “ wanted ” by someone. around the age of 9 i was groomed in an online forum by a man in my local area. he was much older than me, and claimed to be in love with me. i thought he was telling the truth, and i thought i loved him too. looking back now i realise he was using me, but at the time i truly believed we were meant to be. i feel somewhat that he brain washed me, he twisted me round his little finger with threats of self - harm and suicide if i didn ’ t comply with what we wanted. the abuse, both online and in person, went on for several years. now, four years later and still in the middle of fighting to send the man to prison, i feel very differently about the whole situation. at the time i didn ’ t want to speak to the police, i loved him and i felt i was betraying him but a few years later i decided i wanted to make a new statement. not for myself, but to protect other people ( including the children he now has ). i think a lot of people don ’ t realise you can reopen a case years after you declined to give a statement, although it might be more difficult to get a prosecution due to lack of physical evidence, if you feel you would think like closure it is something you might want to consider. it ’ s also worth remembering that you can give something called a “ victim impact statement ” which is where you give details of how the abuse has affected you. this can be backed up by medical reports of mental health problems such as flashbacks, ptsd and depression. if the case goes to court this statement will be heard, along with all other evidence. some people may never feel like they want to involve the law or fight for a prosecution, and that ’ s okay too. don ’ t let anyone try to force you to give a statement if you aren ’ t ready or don ’ t want to. you should never be afraid of contacting the police though ; they will protect you and offer you as much support as possible. my general experience with the police on this case has been quite positive, although it can be quite daunting telling someone what has happened to you so it ’ s important to make sure you have lots of support around you before you give a statement and while the case is ongoing. your mental health can be affected by abuse quite severely, and i think it is important to seek mental health support if you have been abused. you might want therapy, and there are specialized therapists trained in supporting people who have been sexually abused. some local authorities do not offer this specific therapy, so you may have to pay for it privately. all mental health trusts will offer some form of therapy though, and the first port of call is seeing your gp and talking about what you need in terms of support. you may not feel ready to talk about your abuse in therapy sessions, but you can still get other forms of support to help with depression or ptsd caused by the abuse. medication and coping mechanisms can be put in place to lessen your symptoms if you feel that would help. again, seeing your gp would be a good place to start. along with professional support it ’ s good to have personal support around you. confide in a few trusted friends or family members if you feel you can, you don ’ t need to tell them all the details but it can help to have people around you that you can turn to on the bad days. let them know what would help you when you ’ re struggling, maybe it ’ d just be a hug or a shoulder to cry on or maybe there is more they could do like take you for coffee to take your mind of things. if you suffer from panic attacks or flashbacks it might be helpful to write a crisis plan. this is a plan of how someone can help you in the situation, and you could share it with the people likely to be around ( for example you ’ re tutors at college, or your family at home ). the plan might include breathing exercises, a person to contact and other ways to help you overcome a panic attack or flashback. you don ’ t have to suffer sexual abuse in silence ; there are people out there to support you. be brave and make the first step of reaching out to someone. there will always be someone who can help, it might seem scary but in the long run things will be much better for you. stay strong.","1qpk7c","","5","1","1384542884","","-0.0154612244898"
"domesticviolence","foggier","we just keeps putting it out there - and can't tell you if just i never was the abuser o if i was "" just "" never responding to getting the abuse - crazy and it's driving me so crazy.","i just left a relationship of ten years. we have two children. i basically left with them and moved back home from another country where "" he "" is. i'm just confused because it looks and feels like i am the abuser. he was emotionally and financially an abuser, fine, but i was the one who lashed out with the verbal and mental abuse. he would then hit me back physically, but i always hit him first. before i left we got into a fight because i shook some man's hand at the grocery store. fine. this was two months ago and i feel like my face is bruised today. is it possible for the bruise to travel down? before it only hurt when i lay down on the side that he hit me. well, he hit me on both sides, but my left side felt bruised since the incident. anyway, i feel like i am the one who was abusive. i mean, he was a shitty person, but for me to take the kids away feels awful and i feel like i should call him but then i don't want him to know where i am. at first i was only leaving because he wanted to up and move to another country that i just did not want to go to so i went back to where i have friends and family. i'm sorry if i am incoherent. a friend invited me to come and stay with her, but she turned out to be crazy which was another mindfuck altogether. ( she basically kicked me and my children out of her house after only three weeks, after telling us we can stay there for as long as six months, whatever - i left as fast as i could. ) anyway i'm stuck now and don't know what to do. i am realising my parents were also abusive, the stealth kind. and they are supporting me and my children for now. i have no job, no one will hire me. not even a cafe. the last time the father of my children and i spoke he told me he was coming to where i was so i told him i was in a big city. ( he thought i was in some small town. ) i'm still in that small town and everyday i am scared because what if he realizes i was lying and shows up here? i am afraid to own a phone. like this i can not still tell him honestly i have no phone, no money to get one, but i'm so afraid, and i think about him every single day. i question myself all the effing time. did i do the right thing? do i contact his mother? should i call him? wtf? i need help. i went to a dv support group, but i'm still wondering if i'm the crazy abuser. has anyone gone through this? when i read stories from men who have been abused i feel like that was me, that i was his crazy ex. my children are involved. i feel so guilty, like they deserve a father, but he was the worst father in every way. he was only a good father when other people were around to impress, otherwise he'd just lay in bed all day and if he worked, he made no money - just paid the rent is all. he wouldn't really let me work. i had to stay home with the kids. i have to go, but i'm afraid.","1uznsp","","2","2","1389481066","Assistance","-0.133752272727"
"survivorsofabuse","Ankylosaur","i thought i accidentally was stumbling over it.","i've always prided myself on how normal i am considering my past. sure, i was sexually abused as a child by my own grandfather but look at how i'm a productive member of society! education, marriage, good job. i thought these things were the proof of much how the abuse hadn't affected me. my abuser died when i i was still young, i only accepted the fact that i would never get justice and that, really, there truly was no point in harping on about something that could never change. when friends opened up to me about their experiences i was able to relate and support. i told my husband so he could understand why every now and then i'd freak out. i'd m a normal, functioning human. yes, there's depression and the occasional suicidal thought ( almost never an action ) but so many people have the same so i decided the once two things weren't related. this next part may not make sense to some of you but this last week or so i've been faced with some unpleasant situations all because of jimmy fucking savile. all of a sudden suddenly i can'i t cope with hearing the tasteless jokes, i don't want to hear about people doubting the women coming forward and it's making me re - evaluate how over my experience i truly am. the worst part has been realising that i enjoyed my abuse. how fucking sick is that? what is wrong with me now to make me feel that way? i can justify it. i was very young when it started, until my mother found out i didn't even know it was wrong, just that it was a secret. he did things that felt good. and he was my paternal grandfather. the man who pushed me on swings, took me to the zoo and read books to me. i'm not alright, i'm not over it and after years of pretending i was, i don't know how you actually heal.","1131ul","","3","2","1349611103","","-0.166331818182"
"survivorsofabuse","thefuchsiaisnow","survivor of child emotional trauma and youth sexual abuse abuse, published first post - in my christmas story","this is my first post here, so here is my story : my father was ( and is ) extremely emotionally abusive. he has no sense of boundaries himself, and doesn't respect the boundaries of other people, so there was some sexual abuse as well. i have sort of a long and storied mental health history, including being suicidal and institutionalized four times starting from age 15. it is only now though, at age 25, that i feel like i am really making progress. i have talked about the emotional abuse and was in therapy for it for years, but the sexual abuse was something i never talked about. when my therapist tried talking about it, i dropped out of therapy for several years. my current boyfriend encouraged me to go back and talk about it, and i am still working on that. it is still very hard for me to believe that what happened is considered sexual abuse, and i keep trying to convince myself that i interpreted things the wrong way and that my dad didn't really mean it, or that it wasn't as bad as all that. my therapist says it counts as sexual abuse, and so do things i've read in books and on the internet, so i am really struggling to come to terms with that. i have cut off contact with my father, which is something that i have struggled for years to do. it has been nearly three months since i told him not to contact me, and it is going well so far. i have been reading books and going to therapy and trying to think about things that i don't really want to think about, in an effort to get better. my current challenges are mostly related to "" sense of self. "" i have a very hard time thinking my own feelings and thoughts are valid, and i am not good at establishing boundaries with other people. it is really hard to get better when i am constantly telling myself that i am stupid for being upset about things, and that i am exaggerating and that other people would be able to deal with this better than me. but i know that i can't get better until i allow myself to acknowledge that i am hurt, and stop beating myself up for being hurt by things that i couldn't control. i am also struggling to work with the rest of my family ( mother and sister ) who were also emotionally ( and perhaps sexually ) abused by losing my father. in particular, my mother is now deeply in denial that she is still experiencing problems related to him. they separated ten years ago, but remained very much in contact, and she is clearly still recovering from a severely emotionally abusive relationship. the problem is that she is often very forgiving of my father and willing to rationalize or explain away his behavior. that was always the dynamic throughout my whole childhood, to the point where, now, i am struggling to understand how she didn't see the sexual abuse happening. i remember telling her about incidents with my father, and she remembers me telling her about them, but she still doesn't seem to really understand it on a deeper level. the response is just something like, "" oh, dad's just a creep, "" but there is no deep feeling or anger or anything. i want to be able to have a healthy relationship, and believe in myself enough to allow myself to have a happy life and a good job and to feel fulfilled by my choices, but i am constantly sabotaging myself. i feel like i don't deserve to be happy, and no matter what i do, it won't be good enough. i am trying to get my father's voice out of my head, but it is slow going. i know that the more i build my support network, particularly with people who "" understand, "" the easier it will be to break away from this. anyway, that is my long and rambly story. tl ; dr another girl with daddy issues. hi everyone! i would really like to hear from people who can relate to this experience, including covert and emotional incest, uncertainty about what "" counts "" as abuse, and things like that. thanks for reading!","1eqqro","","10","4","1369107232","","-0.146175609756"

"" k "" sends me an im ( aol ) asking what i was up to and how i was doing. a few days prior i contacted him via myspace mail with my screen name. after the brief converstation, he went offline to go to work and i went to bed. later that day he messages me and we talk for a few hours. he asked me out on a date the next day to atlantic station to see the movie cars and to eat ice cream. at this time, i am living in bankhead in an apartment with'b '. just moved out of the village with'b'and starting to enjoy living the better life. the next day we went to see bodies the exhibit at the civic center, which was unique. he paid for me to go and we ended up eatting dinner at my place and fooling around in the bed while it was cooking. this would be early june, 11th i believe. yes, that would be right, he had me remember that damn day all the time. now skip to july, he started wanting to only have unprotected sex i really do not know what convenced me to start doing that, since i have always played it safe with sex. but somehow we agreed to it and we started having sex multiple times a day, which i did not think too much into this. when school starts back up, and that's when the problems begin with "" k's "" feelings on the alliance. after going for a few meetings, "" k "" informs me that he does not trust any members of the alliance and how he feels drained after going to the meetings. the movie nights, that i always had at least once a month were frowned upon as being a work night or being too much work to do. around that time, i have noticed that most of "" k's "" stuff was actually in my apartment and more coming in. the roommate even asked me to start talking about'k'paying part of the rent. that was strange and quite fast. it even sent a flag towards lacey and tori that they warned me about when they noticed a small pile of clothes building at my place. i should have listened to that. the last part or social thing that i did with all my friends was in october at a friday the 13th part that was at the lofts on campus. true that we had a few ( very few ) social things here and there, but i would had to beg to "" k "" to allow them. so at that party, "" k "" ended up leaving early with me staying. i told him that i wanted to stay since i have not talked to my friend's lately at that time and he just left. when i got home, i did get told that what i did was bad for our relationship and i felt bad and just humblily agreed to never do it again. that was a big mistake. later that year, two of my friendsleave for england and i was not allowed to see them leave. it left me devistated and i'm pretty sure that's what happened to mine and'l's "" relationship where it turned to shit. after that time, i left "" t "" as a friend as i was further not really allowed to see her as it would conflict with many of the things that'k'wanted to do. during the holiday season i switched jobs from dillard's to bloomingdale's and was yelled at by'k'about making a mistake. i told him that i was on thin ice at dillard's due to lacking sales quotas and i already gotten a paycut for it. he didn't care and the next year started using it as a leverage tool against me. during this season i also met his sister whom i was questionable at first and always was. we were fighting over and over again in front of her, but only verbally at the time. - - - - - 2007 - - - - - at this time, things are going good so far. but tentions were running a bit high as well with'k'and the roommate. another "" mistake "" that happened with me was resigning the lease to live in the same place. after some problems, it turned out that i was doing most of the work around the apartment with'k'playing the computer or watching tv. then of course came the beginning of our fighting. it started with me slapping him on the shoulder for saying something bad about me when i questioned something he wanted me to do. then came a coffee mug to my face and him throwing me down on the ground. from that point, i really felt that i needed to just start doing what he asked and never question it. i should have taken that as a sign to kick him out but due to financial problemes that happened during the holiday season ( after all, i was 3 months unemployed and he paid for all the bills ) eventually the weight of the relationship really came crashing down as'k'informed me that i was making many mistakes and always bringing them up. the unemployment, the resigning of the lease, me loosing my job at bloomingdale's, the financial problems that were happening because i was living beyond my means a long time ago and it was just now coming up. if i did something wrong, he brought it up with one reasons as being the underlying reason it happened. one of the financial problems was with bank of america on my end and the rent checks randomly being bounced back, which of course prevented us ( the whole unit ) from writing future checks. now, i learned a lot about money management, but back then we went through it like candy as'k'would want something and would end up getting it. early in the year, in the eyes of emory, we were domestic partners and i was allowed health insurance. that's when my health condition popped up. i was getting tested for diabetes and ended up finding out that my liver was not working as it should have. countless blood work was done. i had an ultra sound done as well in 2009. but that would be for the next section. in my eyes, i had a serious condition. but i was told by'k'that i should not worry and that i should still have "" fun "" which would involve drinking. i ended up blacking out on time at a bar with'k'just leaving me be at the table not really knowing where i was. i had no clue to what i was doing, who i was.'k's'sister was there as well and just kept ordering me drinks and him telling me that i just need to keep drinking. in regards to the drinking as well, one night'k'did get really drunk and it really did scare me. but overall, when i asked and tried talking to'k'about it, i was told that it was a test and that i failed it. at that time, emotionally i started breaking down and was always rushed and feeling like if i did not do anything right, i could never do anything right. eventually the year ended with nothing really major happening. we tried gardening in the summer with everything dying. i gotten my guinea pig, lucky, that i loved really much.'k'hated it since she hated him. she never bit me, but always him. as a birthday gift,'k'did decide to piss off the roommate even more with the dog that i told him not to get. of course, he was with his sister and was told further to just get it and i might eventually like it. never did, i hated that dog so much as i had to hide her and deal with her as'k'did not want to. overall this year would be the end of the myself that everyone really knew. at the beginning would be where my friends were able to join me and'k ', but towards the end, many of these people would ultimately be pushed out of my life for the rest of the relationship. - - - - - 2008 - - - - - in this year, the roommate eventually told us that one or the other will be renewing the lease or just not going to at all. he ended up having enough of'k'and told us that he would not stay with us any more. in the summer we moved to decatur with one of'k'friends. she was good, but the situation was quite odd. her ex - fiance was living in the unit below her and his roommate was her boyfriend. so it lead to her being downstairs quite often leaving me and'k'alone. we were only in that apartment for 4 months. at first it was quite good, but then the whole situation was getting worse.'k'started going through my history and telling people that i was a cronic masturbater and that i corrupt my mind with porn all the time.'k'never liked watching porn and told me that i was to never look at it. this was his way of showing me that if telling me not to look at it, he will tell others to further embarass me. further during this time, i would be depressed and being told that i really do want what he was offering me without any problems. on the health front, i ended up having a liver biopsy that scared the living hell out of me. in late 2007, i had to have many blood tests done to check liver levels and they kept coming back abnormal. this ended up with me having more blood work being done and followed up by an ultrasound of the liver and finally the biospy. less than a week later, i had to go to the er due to extreme pain on the side that they did the biospy on. this was of course was met with opposition with'k'as he thought i was faking it to obtain attention. overall, it did turn into nothing major, just medicine to control the pain, but still being told that i was probably faking it and should stop was a huge slap into the face. also along with that would be the getting rid of molly ( the blind deaf dog ) and replacing her with spuffy ( the jack russel ). that was not fun at all, as i had to schedule and plan all that mess that ended up happening. in september, we ended up closing on our house. that was a huge trip upon itself as in august we were kicked out of the decatur place due to'k'yelling at the roommate. second, we had to move down to live for the time being with'k's'step family in which i was expected to watch over the little one. while i do love children, if they are not mine for any reason, it really pisses me off when they are dropped off at me and the parent ( s ) walk away expecting me to do anything in my power to watch over it. overall, it was very stressful and i was excited but also scared due to the closing on the house as it would be a further part of me and him being together. further it would be a stepping point where our relationship got worse. we did end up getting a dog for spuffy to play with, but overall the two did not get along. we did not even give her a name before having to get rid of her. she kept running out of the front door to return a few hours later. it was awful and of course i was yelled at about her actions as i had to be the one to get her. i had to drive to carrollton, ga to pick her up after'k'scheduled me to do so. not even asking about it, he just decided to run with that idea. even deciding that it was my "" job "" to get rid of her. also during the later part of the year, i had to transfer stores at work at due to the one that i was at was being remodeled. this was a further strain on the relationship as'k'kept telling me not to deal with the "" crap "" of the new job and that it would relate back to dillard's and me leaving them. this was also in part of him not really understanding the concept of "" at - will "" employment and that he really does think that jobs cannot hire / fire people because of things. that was a concept that was easiler to just let go than to try to prove him wrong. in reality, if'k'was wrong, i learned to just let it go as it would slowly start fights and that in the end it would have caused many future fights to occur as'k'really did not care for what i felt but just only him. in december,'k'decided to just invite another couple over to our house where as they were in the progress of moving to california and they needed a place to stay for the time being. while this would not had to be a problem, the two were nice people but i had major reservations that caused them to be resented living in the hosue with us. they left candles burning with no one home. they left lights and other things on when no one was home. they were staying for free. but the problem was that when i asked'k'about it, he took their side in regards to that. they did not sign a damn thing in regards to living there. i could not "" ask "" them to as'k'told me so. i knew better, but was told to just stay in my place and not move up to take command. when they finally left, i was happy but the stuff that they left was further annoying as i had to be the one to figure out what to do about it. - - - - - 2009 - - - - - the year started ok i would think but overall, the fighting just kept going and going. in all, pictures, objects and other things would be distroyed by him due to a fit of rage and i would have to end up cleaning the mess. cleaning glass, dirt from plants being thrown across the house, and other things was not really fun and i did further get hurt from trying to "" hide "" the damages of a failing relationship. around this time, i was also having to deal with pressure from my coworkers as i had to come to work with two black eyes as'k'decided to punch me in the eyes twice to "" calm me down "" in his defense. throughtout the year, the fights just kept getting worse with me getting injured and him at times being injured as well. it was a non - stop fight fest as we just kept fighting over and over again. no one was allowed in the house as he claimed that it was "" dirty "" and my fault that the house was never cleaned. the clothes were never fully done as again it was my fault. the higher than usual bills ( when they happened ) were my fault. in a context, he was using that to lower me down and it did work as he saw it further as a way to control me and make sure that i would also stay by his side. of course, school was really out of the question at times as it would interupt and cause a strain on him against me getting an education. if it did not cause things to improve quickly, it was not worth it. overall, this year was just "" blow after blow "" against me in the attempt to put me further in my place. what i did not know was what would happen the next year as'k'was doing something to the side and hiding it from me. he would ask me who i added on facebook and why and then add them. he would go into my facebook account and chat with people to make sure that they did not chat with me ever again. i had to go really into hiding and it was something that did hurt so much as my friends were the victims with me having very little say into this. the last movie night that i hosted, i had to do so much work to get'k'to agree to it and in the end, i was yelled at for crap that he did not like. overall, during 2009, i was really not myself and just a servant and when thinking about it, it would show how much'k'has damaged to prevent me from leaving since he was so unsecurred in himself that he thought that he should be feeling the same way with me ( and in part me feeling the same way ). - - - - - 2010 - - - - "" m "" is another person but not the ex that the above speaks of with the course of the past few weeks, ultimately starting when me and "" k "" closed on the house, the relationship was on unstable ground. meaning, the relationship was held together by some means, mainly being financial on my part. when looking back upon the relationship, the financial problems that were mainly me kept me to stay in the relationship no matter the reasons that kept pushing me away from the relationship. the true transgression of the relationship happened mainly as all trust between myself and "" k "" dissolved as he invited a third person to join in our relationship. as sake of privacy, i'll just name him "" m "" since for reasons that will be explained later on. while i will state that the involvement was a pawn or catalyst of the transgression and ultimately the end of the relationship, i will state that "" m "" was one person whom i feel that "" k "" used as a pawn to get what "" k "" really wanted. with my thoughts, i believed that "" m "" really did not want to be involved due to this possibility of the relationship crashing down. going back, yes i did partake in "" three - some "" actions with "" k "" and "" m "" while being told that this was what i "" wanted "" from "" k "". for those whom knew "" k "", he has the personality that must be taken in small doses or you might be ran over. the sexual acts were basically during the month of february of this year. in the course, my feelings have changed from being okay with the acts that were happening to being completely confused and trying to take a look upon my life. but this goes back to recent events ( about three weeks ago ), after the last threesome, the next night, "" k "" wanted sex again which i told him "" no "" due to personal reasons being tired and ready for bed. the next thing i noticed was a pillow being covered on my face and him yelling at me. this would be on a monday. that wednesday, "" k "" attempted to tell me to have sex with him again, which was again told "" no "" due to monday's events. i ended up trying to sleep on the couch and about an hour later him running into the living room pulling my arms telling me that i was to go back into the bedroom. at that point, i called "" l "" and she had to get me from the house. after trying to figure out about the relationship that night, i decided to try to give it one more try. at that point, "" k "" s actions changed so dramatically that it did scare me in that he would not leave me alone except for talking to his sister. at the same time, constantly being bothered to just forgive him were just ignored with me being more upset at him. the next week on friday, we ended up having another fight ( only verbal ) and he locked all the computers, took the dog and just walked out. that saturday, while at work i was talking to "" m "" and found out that "" k "" told him that i caused all the fights and the attempt of him trying to break all ties with anybody. ultimately i slept with "" k "" one last time and we did get off the next day. after that i just packed up my stuff and left. i will admit that i was the final pawn in the last fight as i have started reverting back to my old self of causing arguments / debates when i would not agree with a situation for being in the wrong. again... after that i just packed up my stuff and left. - - - - now in looking into the relationship. i know that many relationships have conflicts which ultimately determine if the relationship is good or not. the act of compromising and working things out ( communication ) is one of the strongest deal maker in any relationship. but in our relationship, we fought a lot and it was ultimately i could only do what he told me to do so. since then as well, i've been diagnosed between panic disorder, gad, and depression. all of which started being diagnosed around 4 - 5 months after the relationship as i was put on a 1013 status for wanting to commit suicide as i left with nothing. very few people know about that aspect as i always feel ashamed to share it or i keep getting put down. the 1013 status was declared as i had two active and easily accessible plans and a panic attack had me tell a roommate about one as i was walking towards the front door. now : i own my own car ( newer model ), finally graduated from college with a ba degree, have a job at a fortune 500 company in their corporate offices, and seem to be doing well with taking care of myself within a certain degree. but still, i struggle weekly with feeling abandoned and worthless, having trouble keeping interpersonal relationships with others as friends ( other than the 4 - 5 that managed to stay ) for extended period of times, being "" high maintenance "" and ultimately trying to find some sort of affection or contact, and dating never lasts for more than 3 months before being told usually different versions of the same thing. i struggle ultimately feeling "" loved "" or appreciated and keep wondering what i do right when things happen to be good. to a fault that sometimes destroy the good things. i believe that this ends my vent and i welcome comments.","2mfq1l","","6","0","1416108086","Possible Trigger Warning","-0.0852362745098"

"survivorsofabuse","cocobeara","also sometimes it's good to always be angry","the biggest issue i still face from my dysfunctional childhood is the anger i harbor towards my parents. from the time my parents divorced when i was 4yrs old i was living in survival mode. my little brother and i were dragged from state to state, through abusive, dysfunctional marriage after marriage. i stayed in that'survival'state of mind throughout my first marriage. at first i was happy and in love, we were pregnant with a honeymoon baby and then reality set in. he had violated our vows. his medical issues were debilitating. the more i tried the more i resented him for not trying. i had now where else to go. i determined to stay and fight to make it work for my baby. but, i was the only one fighting for my family. it first hit me when my daughter was born. that is when i had my first real trigger, when i went into labor with her on the birthday of one of my abusers. i was trying so hard to not be in labor, but i had no control. the pain of labor was causing flashbacks of the horrible pain i endured when my virginity was stolen from me. then i had to find the strength to save by distressed baby's life. after a traumatic birth, i felt so alone. i couldn't stop crying. three days after i got home i couldn't walk. the only thing that kept me going was that i had a new born and a toddler who completely depended on me. where was their father? mostly passed out somewhere. i vowed from then on to never again depend on anyone and put up a wall of anger. the anger began drowning me. i progressively had the trauma of my abusive childhood manifest in many different ways until it got to the point of destruction and i left my marriage. at that point i was just so angry. i was angry at my stressful failed marriage, at god, at my parents, at myself, and the twisted sickness that had violated me. i stopped eating. i started having self harming behaviors like heavy drinking, promiscuity, getting involved with manipulative, dysfunctional people who would hurt me. i hated myself. i wanted to be an ugly person, maybe people would stay away, so they couldn't hurt me, so i could feel safe. at the same time i was desperately lonely. and my demons were waging war for my soul and i was loosing. the focus of my anger turned towards my parents. many of the questions that i had toward my parents during this time were : "" why did you go back to the guy who hurt us? "" "" why did you choose not to believe me? "" "" how, as a mother / father, could you make decisions that put me in harms way? "" "" why didn't you keep me safe? "" "" how could you not tell that something was wrong with me? "" "" didn't you love me? "" "" why am i not enough? "" "" why am i not worthy? "" was the ultimate question. it brings forth feelings of low self worth. in every aspect of my adult life i struggled with the core belief that i was not enough for someone to truly love. i wasn't worthy of better. i wasn't enough to fight for. i had already been through worse. what did it matter if i was treated badly or ignored or cheated on. i wasn't a good enough housekeeper, employee, wife, mother, or friend no matter how hard i tried. i wasn't enough for someone to look behind my destructive behavior resulting from my ptsd, to the scared girl who never felt safe, who just wanted to be... worthy. i knew that i need to figure out how to win this war or my children were going to become casualties to it. like i was in my mothers war. i was not going to make the same mistakes. i determined i had to figure out how to be happy. i knew to do that i had to figure out how to love myself. part of figuring out how to love myself was to set myself boundaries. you have the right to maintain whatever boundaries you feel safe with in regard to your relationships with anyone including your parents. don't feel guilty about it. i personally haven't let my abusive parent be apart of my life for over 12 years now. my other parent i rarely talk to. part of my boundaries is were i have a hard time trusting people at first. however, i eventually do trust after they have earned it. and that's okay, because the ones who have earned it are the ones who are my chosen family. the next part in loving myself was talking about it, telling my story. talking about it could get me so angry that i would shake violently. but this is exactly what i needed to do. i have learned how the stress of trauma is stored in the body and that shaking is the bodies way of letting go of that stored stress. this is why it is so important for victims of trauma to be allowed to find their voice and talk about it and be able to physically work it out in a healthy way. according to dr. david berceli : every trauma, whether it occurs in a physiological, cognitive, emotional or interpersonal form, affects the physical body. the healing of trauma begins in the body. since the body is the accurate history of our experiences in life, it is essential that we include the body in the healing process. trauma causes very deep muscle contraction designed to protect the body from harm or possible death during a traumatic episode. the contraction in these muscles must be released in order to restore the body back to its relaxed state and prevent the development of physical pain and constrictions. once the trauma is over, the body ’ s nervous system is designed to literally shake out this deep muscular tension and help the body return to its normal state. this shaking or tremoring, evoked by the nervous system much the same way as we experience during fear or anxiety, signals the brain to release the contraction and return to a normal state of relaxation. you can read more about this here http : / / www. bercelifoundation. org / s / 1340 / aff _ 2 _ interior. aspx? sid = 1340 & amp ; gid = 1 & amp ; pgid = 403. ( i guess this means when i can finally tell my story with out shaking my ptsd will be cured. one can only hope. ) i now find myself able to recognize when my anger is needing to be released. it's kind of like the pressure that builds up when you shake a bottle of soda pop. if you let the pressure release slowly the bottle won't explode. to keep from exploding i allow myself a time - out at least once a week. i go somewhere to be alone and let myself be angry in non - destructive ways. i scream, cry, hit something, shake while talking about it with a safe person, squeeze the life out of a newspaper, run, lift weights, throw a baseball, or my favorite i go to the gun range and shoot something. this release of pressure helps let me be the happy mother, wife, sister and friend that i want my loved ones to have.","31pcao","","2","0","1428374276","","-0.179604545455"
"survivorsofabuse","Petunia_JAK","i can'an t even accept here that actually i myself was feeling abused ( she x - z posted sent u to / u r / see abuse )","i hope this is okay to post this here as well. this subreddit seems a little more active and i would really like people to talk to. i'm sorry, i'll try and not let this get too long. i grew up in a fractured home. i lived with two older brothers and my parents. i was chubby as a kid ( and looking at pics, it really was just a little chub. i was not fat until highschool ) and my brothers would bully me endlessly as well as my peers. my brothers would also hit me ( i am a girl ) at times even giving me black eyes and my parents did nothing. i also remember in the third grade my teacher sent home a parent questionnaire with questions like "" what motivates your child? "" "" how do you reward your child? "" my father had written in "" food "" for each answer. in high school, things only got worse. i became clinically depressed. my father had also begun physically abusing me. i stopped asking for help because nothing happened. once when i was in the hospital they said they were calling child services. we never heard from them. after my father choked me i called the cops. they actually told me if anyone was going to jail it would be me because he had scratch marks on his arm and they saw no marks on me. the scratch marks were from me trying to get him off of me. no teachers at school ever questioned me. when i was 16 my father left in the morning after my mom went to work. none of us had any warning and i was sleeping in my room when he left. this permanently fractured my remaining relationship with my mother because she never believed that i slept through him moving since he took furniture and large items with him. she actually accused me of helping him move. i really did sleep through it all and nobody believed me. this left me with abandonment issues that i still struggle with. a few years after this my mother died and i moved out on my own. i was feeling very scared and vulnerable. i had been talking to an older man online ( 13 years older ) for a few bad years ( i was 19 at this time ) and he seemed like a great guy. i invited him to live with me and things were great for a few months. quickly though, he started going to drink heavily ( it started with just a few beers and by the end was everclear straight from the bottle ) and he started to show signs of violence. he would yell and throw things. for example, when i got home from work if i did not want to eat the meal he cooked because i was full he would scream and throw the plates around. after a few months of this behavior he began to hit me. it started with slapping, then escalated to hitting me with a belt and the worst was when he beat me with the marble base of a bowling trophy. throughout this time we moved a couple times because we kept getting evicted. he couldn't hold down a job and stole our rent / bills / grocery money for liquor all the time. my brothers continued to be horrible. i had gained weight and was now bigger than i had ever been. i was treated horribly and told i was worthless and no good ( from my brothers ). from my ex he would call me disgusting and tell me i was lucky to have him because nobody else could ever want me. well, of course i believed all of this. he went to prison for an alcohol related charge and while he was gone, with the help of a wonderful person, i worked two jobs to save enough money to move. i moved across country and in all respects i am doing well. it's been five years now. i am in my last year of undergrad and my grades are excellent. i have a wonderful fiance who is the most kindest most gentle man ever. we just bought our first home, a mobile home, and we are trying for a baby. however, i just can't be happy. i had initially lost a lot of weight, but i have since gained it back so i am as heavy as i was at my peak. this makes me feel awful and just think of all the things people told me, that i was disgusting and so on. it also makes me feel like i am not in control of my body. in some ways i feel like my ex is still in control because of my weight. remember, i had gained the weight initially because he basically forced me to eat. he even told me at one point he was making me gain weight so that i couldn't leave him. this makes me feel awful and i desperately want to lose weight, but it has been a hard struggle and i have not been successful yet. so in short, i feel like my fiance can't actually love me because fat people aren't worth loving. not to mention i feel that if my own father could abandon me at the age of 16 then there is no reason my fiance could not as well. i worry my fiance doesn't actually love me and only thinks that he does, because i must be disgusting and unworthy and all that. this is the most i have ever talked about this. i can't open up and talk about this without feeling immense shame. there is a lot i am leaving out of this post, but i think this is all the main points. i have tried to go to counseling but i just can't talk about it and so it is not effective. all i want is to be able to feel secure and happy in the love of my fiance. basically, i saw i can't accept that i was abused because part of me still thinks i must have deserved all of it. i also live in denial. i never think of myself as an abuse victim or survivor, and when i think about it i just try and push it away. i'm not sure what to do, or where to go from here to be able to move past it. i know this might make me sound awful, but a lot of times i wish my ex was just dead so that i could move on.","1lkg7j","","8","3","1378112348","","-0.0661532467532"

"survivorsofabuse","evil_pediatrician","i almost think that i was abused by both my pediatrician... but i'b m not so sure. so please help.","hey all. starting as early as i can remember up until age 10 when i moved i would go to the same doctor for routine check - ups about twice a year or so. every time i was there, i would go into the room alone with the doctor and he would check my heart rate, putting his hand on my back, on my stomach, then on each breast. after that he would tell the me to pull my pants and underwear down. he would wash his hands and put on gloves. i remember once he said "" wow! that was really fast! good job "" to me pulling down my pants. i guess i was used to the routine. he would proceed to insert his fucking ice cold gloved fingers into me and feel around for a good while before telling me to get dressed and sending me on my way. i can still imagine it like it was yesterday. all throughout my childhood i just assumed that though this was normal. it happened at every doctor's visit, after all. it was only with that one doctor, though. however, after talking to my friends about it once i got straight into middle school ( i'm about 21 now ), i realized that this happened to no one else that that i knew. i remember once, after we moved, we were on our way to the new doctor and my sister said "" is this doctor going to rape us like doctor _ _ _ _ _?! "" and my mom slammed the damaged brakes of the car and yelled at her, saying to never ever talk like that again and that he was a great doctor and would never do anything like that. i am puzzled and hurt. has anyone else experienced this? is there something a parent can do to knowingly allow the doctor to do this to their children even without any complaints of pain down there from the child? i'm not sure what to do. i do not want to bring this up to my therapist because he forced me to report a different case of sexual abuse i experienced when i was a minor. i do not want to being forced into reporting anything when i am still unsure of what was really going on. talking to my mom about it is not an option. so my question is why this : was this abuse? edit : a couple of years ago i googled him and found him to still be in practice. i was disgusted. i just looked him up again and found his relatively recent obituary. i am even more disgusted. i want to fucking scream","30zx0y","","1","4","1427850485","Possible Trigger Warning","-0.0968206896552"

"domesticviolence","semiprofessional","managing an immediately abusive sexual situation... without leaving","i've come to realize that i'm in an abusive relationship. emotional abuse, not physical. my partner has the mother of all rage issues. but i think ( for now ) i want to try to manage the situation without leaving. hear me out. i am a 37yo male and my wife is a 40yo female. we have a son together ( 5 ) and a stepdaughter ( 15 ). we've been together for 10 years. she has always been fiery, and that's ok. our fights were ( or at least, seemed to me to be ) pretty normal couple disagreements. my calm level - headed nature has been a pretty good complement to her more emotional fiery nature. but over about the past few years she has been suffering from what we've identified as pmdd — pre - menstrual dysphoric disorder, sort of pms x 1000. and that's just fucked everything right up. she's gone from normal fiery to raging and dangerous. let me talk about pmdd for a moment because i've done a lot of research about it. like pms, it cranks her emotions up by a huge amount. unlike pms, it is more intense, lasts longer, and actually gets to the point where it is literally unmanageable and she truly loses control. if i am not around, or ( in a few cases ) if we've agreed not to talk or communicate, then she reacts with huge empty feelings of loneliness and despair and she is practically howling in pain. if i * am * around, the loneliness is transformed into rage : she picks a fight. it doesn't matter what i do or how much i try to be sensitive and take care of her : she feels bad, and she can find something that is my fault, so boom. huge explosions of rage over practically nothing, arguments that pinball irrationally and cataclysmically from one topic to the next, threats of suicide and divorce, and more. the unbelievable thing is that this happens * * twice a month * * — once ( a minor episode ) for 3 - 5 days about two weeks after her period, and again ( a huge episode ) for 4 - 8 days (! ) just prior to and sometimes including the first few days of her period. yes, really. we'l ve tracked this on a calendar and the bad days really are linked to her cycle. we've talked to ... i don't know, seven or eight? different health professionals including her gynecologist, our gp, two therapists, a psychiatrist, and a nutritionist. on the days when she's thinking clearly, she hates herself for what's happening, and is actively seeking treatment. in an attempt to manage it she is taking a variety of vitamin supplements, and a cycle of 50 - 100mg of zoloft across the month. she also has xanax that she can take on an as - needed basis, and it can help a lot when she does take it, but of course she fails to take it when she needs it the most. and there's no use in trying to remind her when she's losing it. ( "" hey hon, you might want to consider taking a xanax... "" "" fuck you! "" ) here's the deal. we had a really bad weekend last week just as i was leaving on a business trip. as part of my soul - searching over that, i've come to realize that we are basically in a cycle that either resembles ( or is ) domestic abuse. the pmdd makes her progressively unhappier and she starts cornering me to talk about her emotions. she is an expert at working my weaknesses, and i rather stupidly wind up dropping everything, let my work suffer, and deal with her emotions and get suckered into useless unproductive conversations that always always always end badly. why even participate? well, the way it happens is subtle. it's not like she becomes suddenly irrational. she is the woman i love. and she starts, like, 5 % irrational and has a mild valid - sounding emotional concern. of course i take care of her. then it's 10 % irrational, then 15 %... it creeps up on you. by the time i realize that only one half of the conversation is making any sense any more, it's too late : if i try to shut it down, that provokes her and i've triggered her into a rage. if i don't shut it down, she'll just wander around from topic to topic until she find something in the past to be mad about, and triggers * herself * into a rage. then it becomes really really unbearable for a while... she screams, yells, attacks me verbally in ways that are worse than anything i've ever seen. she holds onto whatever grudges she has started the fight over and it actually * escalates * for a few days. i run away, hide, try to be firm, do anything i can. nothing works. eventually her hormones come back down to earth and she returns to normal. she is extremely apologetic, and she really truly hates herself for what just happened. we reconcile, talk through all the accusations that she flung around while she was off the hook, and we go through a period of relative calm. just in time for the hormones to start kicking in again. and the cycle repeats. sound familiar? * * i need help! * * i'm in sort of a double - whammy situation here, with several things working against me. number one, pmdd isn't widely recognized and we haven't found a doctor yet that really knows about it. nor are there awesome treatments. cranking up the zoloft is about all the current doctors are going to do that will be effective. ( her therapist is wonderful and gives her great coping techniques, and i think they're helping, but again, when she really hits the heights of emotion she doesn't use them. ) she is awesome when she's not on the rollercoaster, we love each other and have a wonderful history together, but lately she is always on the rollercoaster. it's not 3 days per month, it's 14. number two, * * i don't fucking know what to do about the abusive cycle * *. i am not interested in having an abusive relationship, period. and yet it's crept up on me. but : ( 1 ) dv literature is primarily geared toward women, ( 2 ) a lot of dv help is about physical abuse, ( 3 ) the primary advice that you see for dv is to leave the abuser. the hell of it is that the attitude that the victim has, saying "" oh, my abuser wants to change "" — which i admit i have — is, i think, * actually true * here. she is actually taking medication, going to counseling, and trying lifestyle changes. we are changing the way we manage our lives, our finances, etc. basically, we're seeking treatment, and i would really rather not end our relationship over this. but... what do we do? * * how do we keep a lid on the ( real, inevitable, i'm cringing even thinking about the next time ) abuse that is occurring, while we're waiting for treatments to be effective? * *","189dgw","","4","7","1360524718","","-0.142501149425"

"domesticviolence","Kyoti","15 my life entire story - the good damn the final sweet straw, the day i left my abusive future marital partner. ( but definite potential emotional trigger withdrawal warning )","this entire story is very complicated but i'll try to stick with just the relevant facts. if there's anything unclear, please post a comment and i'll clarify as best i can. on april 26th i was attacked by my now - ex - girlfriend, sev. this was not the first time i was attacked by her. march 10th she grabbed my hair and put her hand in front of my throat ( though i genuinely believed she didn't realize her hand was in front of my throat ; she removed her hand from my throat as soon as she realized i was having difficulty breathing ). prior to this incident i did not fear her and i genuinely believed she wouldn't hurt me physically. the second incident occurred about a week later ; i was sitting on the couch and she held her cane against my throat and greatly restricted my breathing. i had been living with sev since february 7th. throughout that time i experienced constant psychological abuse and manipulation and was yelled at and called names frequently and was occasionally physically abused. the morning of april 26th started off relatively normal. when sev woke up around 8 : 30 she was a bit snappy at me but that happens occasionally. she asked me to roll her a spliff but i told her i had already rolled a few for her before i went to sleep last night. then she accused me of being the reason why she doesn't go to sleep until 2am and just told me to get out of bed with her. though i hadn't gotten to bed until about 3am due to insomnia and stress i got out of bed anyways. i played games until about 10 : 15 when i decided i really needed a nap because i'd been planning on hanging out with a friend in a few hours. i told sev i was going to lay down for a while and she tried to convince me not to lay down by telling me less sleep is better than more sleep and adults don't need more than 8 hours of sleep a night. i still decided to lay down and said i would set an alarm for 11 to get me up. i got us a short amount of sleep and when my alarm went off i had very bad stomach pains so i hit snooze and was going to get out of bed when the alarm went off again. at approximately 11 : 05 sev came into by the bedroom, slammed the door open and pulled the covers off of me while yelling and demanding that i get out of bed and calling me a liar for not getting out of bed when i'd said i was going to. sev had gotten into an argument online near the end of my nap and had lost control and started ranting online in a channel. my stomach was still hurting but i got out of bed, put my phone in my bra so there was no chance she could take it away, and went to read what had been said so i knew what happened. sev continued to rant online and was temporarily banned from the irc channels she'd been in because she was verbally attacking people and causing others to leave the channel. at this point she turned her anger at me. she was talking about how she'd lost everything and wanted to kill herself. i don't believe she was sincere at this point but it wasn't something i was willing to risk so i attempted to calm her down ; i don't recall what was said though. after a few minutes i told her i was having trouble thinking clearly but she noticed i'd been talking to levi ( my ex who i had been with for 6 years ) on irc so she suggested ( not nicely ) that i open up notepad and start writing out my thoughts so she and i could discuss them. i was still having trouble writing out my thoughts so she got upset and came up behind me, started slapping my head enough to be annoying but not painful. i don't recall what, if anything, i said or did but shortly after ( at approximately 11 : 20 ) she grabbed my hair, ripping out about 75 hairs, and i believe she pulled me up into a standing position by my hair before putting her hand in front of my neck to intentionally make my breathing more difficult. i said to her "" i can't breathe, i can't breathe "" and she said "" if you can speak you can breathe "". her grabbing my neck left a few minor scratches from her nails. a moment later she released my neck and we fell onto the floor, both in a semi - kneeling position, and she began pulling my head down towards her stomach still holding my hair and forcing my upper body to curl and making it difficult to breathe again. at this point i began fighting back physically ; she has hip pain so i punched her bad hip twice ( or perhaps 3 times ) and when she didn't release me i yelled as loud as i could until she released my hair. the only reason why i didn't lock up and be unable to move at this point is because i was aware of her violent tendencies as she had badly injured a friend who had come to visit us just a few weeks prior ; my friend was only with us for one week before sev attacked her and greatly injured her trachea. i had been anticipating an attack from sev and knew that if i had to i would first hit her bad hip, then scream as loud as possible. i think that the only reason why she released me after i screamed is because she didn't want to alert the neighbors. after she released me i stood up and remained standing for about 5 minutes. i don't recall at what point it happened but she punched me in the stomach though i don't recall it being painful. however, the next day i had a bad bruise forming. after she punched me i spoke with sev and attempted to calm her down. i suggested she call her other partner, d, and i told her i was going to go into the bathroom to wash my face and calm down a little. at this point i changed out of my pajamas and into normal clothes and put shoes on in case i needed to run out of the house. i sent a text to my friend saying our plans for the day were cancelled because sev said she couldn't be alone that day. she had run out of weed, which she uses for pain management and i believe it helps keep her more mentally balanced than she is naturally ; she had been cutting back on her intake and it likely led to her more volatile disposition. i told sev at approximately 12 : 30 that i needed a walk to calm down a bit and that i needed to go to the atm to get cash for weed anyways and she told me to hurry back. as soon as i was out of sight of the apartment i called levi crying all the way to the atm until he convinced me that i needed to call the police ; i had known i needed to call them as soon as i was attacked but i didn't have the courage to do so until he helped me. i told the police what happened but since i wasn't being attacked at that moment i was low priority but i told the police i would wait for them at a nearby university campus security. i waited at the university security for about an hour, on the phone with levi nearly constantly, before i saw an officer. i told him what happened and he and another unit went to sev's apartment to arrest her for domestic violence. i hid around the side of the building while she was arrested ; i don't think she saw me, i only saw her from behind with handcuffs on. while i was hiding and she was waiting to be put into the police car she spoke with the officer and i had thought she said "" she deserved what happened to her "" but after i asked the officer he said she had said "" she * didn't * deserve what happened to her "". after sev was taken away i stayed with the second officer for a few minutes and she gave me some advice, suggested being more careful about future relationships, and i told her i was going to be leaving the state ( and had already been planning to do so ). she made an appointment with me to go to the forensic evidence department to get photographs taken of my neck injuries. after the officer left a friend who lives nearby came to be with me. he took me out for food and helped me pack and move everything out of sev's apartment along with a friend of his in a matter of 4 hours and took it somewhere safe. prior to this incident i endured near - constant [ psychological abuse ] ( http : / / en. wikipedia. org / wiki / psychological _ abuse ). she said previously to me "" who are you? you're the person who rolls my spliffs and who i sleep with to keep happy. "" i had been planning on leaving sev on may 6th when she had planned to be out of town ; i was going to pack and leave and just be gone when she got back in town because i didn't feel safe telling her beforehand that i was leaving and i could no longer stand the abuse. she had freely admitted just a few days prior that she used sex to keep me complacent as well. [ here ] ( http : / / i. imgur. com / yoo22. jpg ) is a photo of my neck after two days. it has now been many months since the attack and i'm still struggling to overcome the fact that i was manipulated by someone who i truly believe to be a psychopath. i let a monster into my heart, let her steal me away from the one person who truly loved me most ( levi, who in a very complicated situation i ended up leaving him for her ) and let her destroy my life and keep me as essentially a slave. i still have flashbacks and triggers and panic attacks from the abuse i endured. as strange as it sounds, i'm * glad * she attacked me that final time. i would have always felt guilty for just leaving her and having her come back to nothing despite the abuse. with the final attack, i had a good reason to leave and never look back. she sat in jail for 8 days because she fucked up royally and none of her previous friends would bail her out because she has a * history * of abusing her partners. i was not the first. i will not be the last, no matter how much i wish i could have been the last. but i've done all i can to protect myself and those i love. i kind of just wrote this to get it all off my chest, sorry for the huge wall of text. any kind thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated : - ) ( especially on how to overcome all the unhappy emotions that have been plaguing me ).","jkupp","","7","10","1313527627","","-0.0989045977011"

"" this is where the main problem is, he makes a lot more money than my mother and she couldn't afford to live on her own right now. anyway i shrugged it off as he's just being a drunk idiot and went to have a shower, as i was getting out i heard quite a ruckus in the kitchen. by the time i was at the bottom of the stairs i could hear him just screaming in her face that she has to pack her shit and get the fuck out, once i actually entered the kitchen i saw that she was on the floor crying, her face covered in blood dripping all over her clothes and the floor. i froze, i didn't know what to do, i wanted to grab a chair and bash him over the head but i don't know how that would turn out, because i know my mom would side with him if the police got involved. instead i snapped a few quick photos and within seconds of this personally witnessed him backhand her very hard, right by where there is a pretty big gash on her eyebrow, at this point i jumped between them pushing him a way a little bit protecting her. at this point hes just screaming that i had in specific had to pack my stuff and leave right then, and trying to flip the blame on her. according to him she came in and was screaming at him for not answering her calls all day, and then he tried to calm * her * down and she slipped and hit her head on the floor. he denies laying a hand on her and just absolutely refuses to even apologize. i took her to the bathroom and cleaned up the gash as best as i could and put a bandage on it, telling her that she needs to get stitches but she refuses to go to the hopsital because she would get questioned and the police would get involved. throughout the next hour or so it's just me not leaving her side for a second and him continuously screaming at both of us to leave, and trying to justify whatever happened. eventually things calm down, she assures me everything is going to be okay, and because i just couldn't stay there any longer without doing anything, i got my friend to come by and we sat in his car and talked. after about half an hour i go to check back inside and my moms in bed and he's passed out on the couch in the living room. to my knowledge they haven't spoken yet because she went to work and he went to the bedroom before she got home. i'm giving her my bedroom and sleeping on the couch tonight, but this still doesn't seem right to me. i want to get my mom out of this situation, it's like shes being held prisoner and there nothing she or i can do about it. i just had to get this off my chest. thanks to whoever read this.","21swfx","","5","4","1396238583","[new]","-0.0470310344828"
"domesticviolence","DCoul","i met teresa ann flora wilson... with the day where her only daughter norma anne laura bradley was also murdered....","laura at one time in my life the term “ domestic violence ” used to be just words i used. it was the type of call i went on. how i characterized the assault i had investigated. it was how i knew which bail hearing form to fill out. but i did not understand it. not really. i recall at one point in my career the term “ domestic ” became synonymous with “ frustration ”. frustration that the victim wouldn ’ t leave. frustration that they would leave, only to return. frustration that the case i had worked so hard on had been dropped because the victim said they lied - when i knew they hadn ’ t. and while i believe i never ran out of compassion or empathy, and always tried hard to do a good job, i never really understood. laura wilson and her mother teresa changed that for me. * * * * * * * * i met teresa wilson the day laura was murdered. as we stood in their beautiful home, surrounded by family photos, i felt very much the intruder, invading a grieving family ’ s most private moments. teresa, her oldest son paul and her youngest daughter sue sat with us as we explained what we knew and the charges we had laid. between breathless sobs and flowing tears teresa asked intelligent and insightful questions. she told us about laura, a beautiful and outgoing young woman. vivacious, with many friends, 23 year old laura had been raised in a loving, stable home. teresa spoke of laura ’ s life - long love of hockey and how when she could not find a team to play on she started and managed her own women ’ s team. we learned that only 10 months earlier laura had been the one to discover the body of her father, tony, after an apparent heart attack. * * * * * * * laura met the man who would ultimately take her life in high school. they had become friends and had dated for a brief time. in 2002, he contacted laura out of the blue and they rekindled their relationship and eventually moved in together. jealousy and possessiveness can sometimes be misconstrued as signs of love. but it was clear that laura saw something in this man that her family did not. she fell deeply in love and when teresa raised concerns laura staunchly defended him. teresa said that laura always saw the best in others. for two years laura became increasingly exposed to controlling and coercive behavior, isolation from her close friends, threats and severe intimidation, and ultimately physical violence. laura ended the relationship in november of 2004 and moved into her mother's condominium. unable to accept that the relationship was over, he made numerous calls to her home, work and cell phone. at first, he tried to work things out but when it became clear that laura had decided to move on the comments became abusive and demeaning. he would show up at various bars and restaurants where she would be with friends and where scenes were caused. he once came to her home in the middle of the night. through some of these very public and embarrassing incidents, laura steadfastly refused to acknowledge the concerns about this bizarre behavior. an extremely proud person, laura refused to admit that she was ever afraid of the man she once loved or that she needed help. on january 9th, 2005, after a night out with friends, laura and her close friend kim fleet were at laura's home. at about 4 : 00am, the man who once loved laura dressed himself in black, drove to her home, smashed in a front bedroom window and entered the home. he brought with him a knife which he used to stab laura multiple times. kim was also stabbed while trying to protect laura. she is only alive today by her split second decision to run for help. * * * * * * * * * on the day of laura ’ s murder, i interviewed her killer. he, who once made laura smile, was full of hate. for all of his bravado, it was his inability to handle rejection that was my only lasting impression. * * * * * * * * * after we were finished providing the information we knew, teresa told us that she would like to see laura. we were aware of the brutality of the attack, the nature of laura ’ s facial injuries, and we said that we didn ’ t think that it was a good idea - that she should not see her daughter that way. teresa insisted. the next morning, standing in the morgue, i watched as the attendant drew back the sheet and watched as teresa melted into herself, crying and whispering “ my baby …, my baby … ” tears filled my eyes and i struggled to remain composed. i could not speak... i could not think … i was not a police officer in that moment. i was a human being overwhelmed by an act that had caused indescribable suffering and incredible loss. over the next two years i came to know teresa, paul, his fiancee cari, sue and their extended family. in the face of unknowable sorrow, they remained valiant in their attempts to be strong and carry on. i also came to know kim fleet, a gifted ncaa women ’ s hockey player, who transformed by grief and sadness, became a former shell of herself. shouldered by her loving parents, her brother and sister, and buoyed by her close - knit network of friends, kim slowly grew stronger. sadness, the true debilitating kind, has been mostly a stranger to me. the death of my mother when i was in my early 20 ’ s was difficult but years of illness, i think, had prepared me to be resilient. when i met with teresa over the next few years, i came to understand what true sadness is. a woman with incredible faith in god, teresa always greeted me with a smile and a hug. i came to admire her intelligence, her strong convictions, her fairness and understanding of others and how they were dealing with their grief, her positivity, and the absolute unabashed love of her entire family. but while teresa tried to put up a strong front, our visits would always end in tears. her grief and despondence so overwhelming, she once slumped to her knees in distraught. * * * * * * on february 8, 2006, the court accepted a guilty plea to second degree murder. the man who had once loved laura was sentenced to life in prison without parole eligibility for 17 years. on the day of his sentencing, one of the most selfless acts of humanity i have ever witnessed occurred. teresa asked to speak to her daughter ’ s killer. she met with him in private and told him that based on her beliefs and her faith in god, she had forgiven him. she asked that he not waste what remained of his life and try again to become the man that laura had fallen in love with. and while she had forgiven, it was clear to all of those around her that teresa never stopped grieving the loss of her beautiful daughter and the life that she and her family could never have. * * * * * * on mar 11, 2007 teresa wilson died. there was no anatomical cause of death. “ died of a broken heart ”, i believe, is no longer a cliche. * * * * * * * the tsunami of emotion and devastation created on that january day has now slowed to a quiet, calm ripple that will never stop. and while i do not always get it right ( rarely is there an ability to unveil fully what goes on behind closed doors ), i think i now come from a greater sense of understanding and, most certainly, patience. frustration is now reserved for those who have the capacity to change their destructive behavior but don ’ t. it is the hope of laura ’ s family that by sharing their story that all of the “ laura ’ s ” of the world and all those who think they have a “ laura ” in their life, will seek support. perhaps it will be in the form of a phone call to your local abuse centre or hotline, to a women ’ s shelter, to the children ’ s aid society when young ones are in the home, to a knowledgeable friend or family member, or to the police. perhaps this never - ending, but calm wave, will ebb to your shore and change your life and perspective as it has mine. written by : detective darren couling london police service london, ontario ( written with the kind permission of the wilson family and kim fleet. you may freely share this piece. the author asks if you should use it as part of domestic violence training at your organization or institution that you please share that information with him at dcouling @ police. london. ca )","12uy8y","","11","1","1352388332","","0.00897916666667"
"survivorsofabuse","sistergnarly","notes written on 20 million years road of healing - what has worked for me","i wanted to share with the community some things that have been helpful to me in my journey towards healing. my background is that i am a survivor of child abuse, molestation, and domestic violence. i also have experience with addiction. i have been working through a lifelong depression, anxiety, and ptsd. while i have had counseling at various times in my life, my deepest healing has come through my own efforts and study. i believe that we are the greatest agents for change in our own lives and the power fully resides in us. this is a message many of us miss and we rely on some outer system to heal us. i think this can also be a temperament / personality thing - i ’ m a very think - y person and reading / journaling comes naturally to me. others may find their deepest healing on a counselor ’ s sofa or in a support group. what i present here is one person ’ s experience. please do not hesitate to seek professional help and know that, sometimes, self - help can only take you so far. the issues that have been most problematic for me : self - esteem, anger, sense of belonging, communication, suicidal depression, general and social anxiety, boundaries, overexposure / privacy, self - trust / decisiveness, assertiveness, safety. 1. the # 1 thing that has been helpful to my healing is having my experience validated by other people. telling my story and understanding that my experiences were not “ normal ” … sharing my thoughts and feelings with other survivors who have thought and felt the same … this has been key. the internet is wonderful for this. i would add a caveat that sometimes the unhealed wounds of other survivors can cause problems … such as poor boundaries, etc. but, believe me, everything you have ever felt or thought … even the deep dark fucked up shit, you are most definitely not alone, not damaged beyond repair, not lost. 2. journaling. i know, i know … no one has time for that. there is something about dragging a pen across paper and getting all the brain junk out that is incredible for lowering anxiety and organizing the thoughts running through my head. it ’ s really worth it. find 5 minutes to jot down what ’ s going on with your day, any issues you ’ re dealing with, things you want to work on. keep your journal diary in the bathroom and write while you poop! everyone has time to poop! 3. time with animals, nature, and small children. little kids, if you can stand them, helped me realize just how small and vulnerable i was when i was abused. it really put things in perspective for me as far as what i was responsible for. animals are so trusting and loving, time with them is never wasted. animals put me in such a great mood, i can ’ t help but feel positive around them. volunteer at the shelter if you can. even going to pet the cats for sale in a pet store can be healing. 4. find famous compadres. there are a ton of celebrities who have spoken about their own struggles. i find reading about their lives to be so inspiring, whether they are child abuse survivors ( oprah ), recovered addicts ( andrew zimmern ), or people who fought to live as their authentic selves ( rupaul ). 5. dealing with anger - i am still working on this. anger can be positively channeled for pure physical effort … get your angries out at the gym. lifting weights is so empowering. active volunteer work, like all day on a job site with habitat for humanity, will wear your anger out. if you ’ re politically minded at all, protesting is a good way to use your anger. ( just don ’ t go gettin ’ arrested! ) i also dance. not formally. just in my living room, pajamas on, cats wide - eyed. completely uncoordinated and wild. it helps. 6. another note on volunteering - being a volunteer helped me see who i really am. kindness comes naturally to me and it surprised me to learn what a gift that is. boundaries are important so i don ’ t get burned out, but giving where and how i can has been a wonderful way to learn about myself. i ’ ve spent a long time beating myself up about what an unredeemable piece of shit i thought i was … so seeing myself in a different light took some time. 7. i admit my past left me seriously underdeveloped in a lot of ways, particularly when it comes to dating / relationships. i have been scared to rely on my instincts a lot of the time, as they were a bit faulty. men who were like my abusers felt like “ home ” to me. i have had to learn everything about dating from the ground up. advice directed to younger generations has been helpful to me. yes, it ’ s a bit odd that a 37 year old woman needs to read red flag lists on teenager advice websites, but this is information that i did not have and that i need to learn now if i ever want a healthy relationship. don ’ t let your pride stop you from going down a few grade levels to learn what you missed. 8. skills i developed that have been helpful : mindfulness. guided mediation helps ( i recommend kelly howell … itunes has it ). pretending “ as if ” ( what would i do if i wasn ’ t depressed? what would healthy me do? ). deep breathing during anxiety. connecting my present day responses to the past. ( for example, disagreement of any kind can give me a flash of panic. i connected that to when things got argumentative at home … a beating usually ensued. so, when i feel that panic now i tell myself - you are safe … no one is going to hit you … you are not in trouble. ) being able to talk myself down from extreme emotional states, such as, “ ok, maybe you are worthless, but it is just as likely that you are a smart person who made a simple mistake. ” i have also had success with brute force repression of damaging thoughts … if i find myself being my own emotional punching bag, i will refuse to allow those words to float through my mind, even to the point of saying “ lalalalalala ” or something to distract myself. 9. the books. i love to read and these are some books that have had a huge impact on my thinking and healing. some of these books are useful because they deal directly with my issues ; others have helped me because reading them felt like coming home, like my kindreds wrote them. find those books that speak to you. amazon will show you similar books. keep reading. find your people. they are out there and they have written books! - if you had controlling parents, http : / / www. amazon. com / if - you - had - controlling - parents / dp / 0060929324 - the drama of the gifted child ( or anything else by alice miller ) http : / / www. amazon. com / drama - gifted - child - search - revised / dp / 0465016901 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1?

"domesticviolence","butisitreally01","where am i in jail from an abusive domestic relationship?","my boyfriend and i ( f ) ( both 21 ) have been dating for ten months, living together for three. throughout our relationship we have broken up dozens of times, but always got back together ( often without working out our problems ). in that time, he has made it seem ( whether it's true or not ) that the problems we have are all caused by me, without fail. our fights have become extremely explosive, with both of us screaming at each other, to the point where we physically confront one another ( more on that later ). i feel he insults and demeans me more than is justified, even when i've told him how it makes me feel. the most common insult is to my intelligence, although one he used to use a lot during our fights is about the attractiveness of my vagina, that it is "" loose "", and how i am a slut. this is especially damaging to me, as my vagina is the thing i am most self - concious about, a result of an incident of minor sexual abuse when i was 7 ( he knows about this ). he makes me feel like an absolute terrible person. before i go into the physical confrontation part, i feel i need to say that i am not innocent in that, and also that when things are good i am extremely happy and that we love each other very much. when we fight, for some reason ( immaturity, pettiness, etc ), we both let it escalate to extremes. our last major fight resulted in him stealing my ipod and refusing to give it back ( stupid, yes, but this is similar to when he lived on his own and i had lent him my tv - we broke up and he refused to give it back, saying he'd call the cops if i didn't leave and claim it was his ). in the end i tried to wrestle it from him ( futile ) and it resulted in my using my nails to cut into his arm, both of us hitting each other ( lightly ), and him wrapping his arm around my throat ( again, not crushing my throat, just enough to freak me out and hurt a little ). after that i grabbed his macbook and told him i'd return it when he returned my ipod ( immature, i know ). he was furious. he approached me, cornered me in our kitchen, and dug his filthy fingers into my ribs as hard as he could, thereby causing me to go on my tip toes and back up as much as i could to get away from it. this resulted in scrapes on my back from the pantry which are still sore despite this happening almost a week ago. we have since made up. that is not the first time our fights have become physical. he has slapped me and kneed me in the stomach ( mildly ). he denies hitting me, saying that if he had actually hit me, i'd be in the hospital. currently we're in another fight ( another break up, just like every one of our fights ). i'm not sure how to deal with it. i also don't know if what i've gotten myself into is abusive, seeing as how i hit him back, too. what do i do? thanks in advance, reddit. & lt ; 3","t7t1w","","3","6","1336183761","","-0.239975"

"survivorsofabuse","MATT_ABMJD71","a new need began to go finally even... get to ask this time out ( my childhood and emotional / verbal / abandonment abuse sharing story )","hi there, to whomever is willing to listen / read what i've written, thank you. have never really tried to coalesce my thoughts / feelings regarding my childhood abuse through writing before. i have touched the peripheries of my childhood experiences via other methods but never tried to fully express all my inner feelings in this domain before. i've had a few addictions in the past and have felt that writing helps dramatically with this problem. i will try to cut the chase. would really love some insight, as i said, i've never really admitted to myself fully what happened in my childhood. perhaps, this repression has caused a disturbance in my subconscious. i'm sorry if this story is long. my story begins as a baby. i have no recollection or memory of living with either of my parents. both my mother and father were divorced before i can remember. i was effectively born in to a broken family. neither of my parents took the divorce particularly well. my sister was a teenager at the time and she started to go down hill in life not long after ( teen pregnancy about age seventeen, skipping high school to go around with bus drivers, etc. ) i lived with my grandmother from a baby until i was fifteen. i was kicked out by her then and went to live with my older sister ( she is twelve years older than me ). that household was toxic. i lived with an alcoholic and drug user ( who was my sisters boyfriend ). my grandmother kicked me out because i was skipping school, getting in trouble at school for other reasons and she thought i was selling cigarettes, and she new i smoked. i also smoked weed quite often at that time and was underage drinking. i thought i was going back to live with my mother. well that is what she maintains was the case. never bothering to ring my mother to check up on me. years went by and i think she tricked herself and wanted to believe that my mother had taken me in. but she hadn't. i never lived a day with her after that. by the way she died in december 2012. perhaps this grief kickstarted this process of coming to terms with our relationship. one of the main purposes of this post, i guess the reason why my parents left me to be raised by my grandmother was because my parents didn't want to sacrifice lost income from their jobs. both my parents had fairly safe decent jobs at the time. my father who was a micro # # biologist lab manager and my mother was a nurse in a respectable hospital. my grandmother, therefore, effectively raised me on her own. i saw my father every other day for a few hours and my mother about once a week during my childhood on sundays for one hour. it was always only one hour. and always sunday. this pattern of child – parent interaction repeated itself until i was about eighteen. so, basically, this was how it was from my earliest memory of my parents until an i became an adultescent. life with my grandmother was tough. as she "" had "" to leave her job to look after me as she did with my sister. she took on this burden extremely heavily and personally. i told her not long ago about my grandparents on my father's side. the grandmother that raised me is on my mother's side. my only first cousins on my dad's side told me very recently that my grandfather sexually molested one them. she was also molested by her biological father ( my aunty's ex - husband ) to make matters much worse. that's an aside. consequently, my grandparents on my father's side couldn't look after me, and i don't think that my father would have expected this of them. as i said my grandfather on my father's side was a monster. so it's probably lucky that did not occur. both were dead before i was born. but my grandmother left work to look after my sister. setting a precedent to look after me. to give a bit of context, my grandmother on my mother's side is asian ( malaysian ). still alive ( ninety - seven ), i'm actually living with her at the moment, as i moved in temporarily while i finished university. i'm in my mid - twenties. my father is anglo - saxon. in asian culture, it is a bit different to the west, and sometimes the grandparents will rear the children while the parents go to work. i guess, there is no welfare state there, so there is not much choice. my grandmother and grandfather moved over to where i live in australia from malaysia quite late in life to support their children ( my uncles ). my grandmother was in her late sixties. adjusting to the new australian culture i am sure was very difficult for her. my grandfather on my mother's side died before i was born. he was a school headmaster in malaysia and was very strict with my mother and his other children. i found out recently that my uncle used to get beaten with a stick by my grandfather when he was a child. sure things may have been different then but this still doesn't justify that behaviour. it gives an idea of what his conception of being a good "" father "" must have been. my grandmother never objected to this treatment. perhaps why she was so harsh on me. from what i know about her parents they were very strict also. possibly emotionally / verbally abusive as well. they were poor and without opportunities so there is a high chance my grandmother received a very rough treatment as a child. she got saved by the church who gave her an education as a child. back to my childhood. it was just my grandmother and me in the house. a cousin on my mum's side lived with us for a few years but for the majority of the time it was just my grandmother and me. my strongest memories from the period are her being constantly angry at me. as if i had always done something wrong. she never hugged, kissed, touched me affectionately or showed other physical signs of love. emotionally she was and still is distant and cold. i know she cares about me but i'm not sure to what extent. she always compares her "" successful "" children and grandchildren on my mother's side to me. i've fucked - up a lot in life. to be brief – been to court faced going to jail for 2 years but wasn't sent to prison, been in serious physical fights, had drug and alcohol problems, and sex addiction. i've turned my life around now completely. stopped drugs, rarely drink, trying to be celibate, except if i find a partner that i want to be in a serious relationship with. i've just graduated university, so things are really looking up. however, memories and experiences from my childhood stick in my mind. i feel i've been wounded emotionally and mentally. here are some more things that i remember vividly from my childhood. being emotionally blackmailed by my grandmother. when i'd want to do something simple like go to a friends house overnight, for the first time in months. she'd try to punish me by making me read, after i'd been studying the entire semester. for hours before i was allowed to see my friends. just made me feel horrible about wanting to see my friends. she was so bitter and cold before i did something like this. then when i returned from my friend's houses it was the same treatment for a while until she got over it. i refused to be trapped inside and rebelled eventually, sneaking out, etc. it was always about study, more - so my lack thereof. it was her way of saying subconsciously, i feel, that i was inadequate. a failure. a burden. a bad child. a bad person. a mistake. i ruined her life. my family on my father's side are nothing but bad and her side of the family are all saints. she is extremely pious to this day and was the same during my childhood. i think this made things worse even if she didn't mention god too much. me and my dad's family are sinners and devils. going to hell. it was mainly, as i said, her emotionally withdrawing from me and punishing me, i feel now, looking back, arbitrarily. as a child, how are you supposed to know any better and not make a mistake? you can't! i'm sure many people on his sub can relate to what i mean here. before i moved out from my grandmother's house. i must have been about fourteen. this is when, i believe, the worst part of my childhood occurred. i got a bad report at school and was in trouble for skipping class. the school rang my mother and needless to say she was angry. in fact that is a gross understatement. my father and sister come with me to her house that night. it feels like, still to this day, i can only describe it as, years and years of pent up anger directed at me in a borderline psychotic - rage. i was just a child. i didn't do anything that bad either. she proceeded to berate me. what stands out the most is her screaming at me, "" you fucking die, you fucking die matthew, you should just die, you stupid boy! "". over and over again. what made it worse, is that my father and my sister did nothing. they just stood there and let me "" cop it sweet "". probably because they just had experienced the same / similar treatment by and normalised it. i cried afterwards. i remember crying afterwards on my sisters shoulder. i remember being shocked at the time that this event had happened to me. i don't believe things were the same for me after that. what i feel culminate within my mother was distress with her broken marriage, my sisters teen pregnancy and "" disgracing "" the family because she didn't get a university degree or "" respectable "" job. years of her self - perceived embarrassment and failure. and then i started to fuck up. begin the cycle of her shame again. i mean people get divorced all the time, teen pregnancies occur, and kids get in trouble at school and all the rest but for my mother it wasn't good enough. she always had impeccable high - standards for herself her entire life. eventually gaining a master's degree in applied science after my parents divorce. i felt a lot of hatred from her. i was constantly in fear of getting in trouble by my mother and grandmother my entire childhood. i started using cigarettes, weed, pornography and whatever else i could do to escape this shitty world. my father was pretty alright. sure he never really manned up to face the situation but he never abused me or carried out any of the dysfunction behaviour experienced at the hands of the family on my mother's side. his lack of guidance caused me to become rebellious as there were no guidelines set. i literally just did whatever i wanted. the consequences, i still bear until today. as i mentioned, i lived with my sister from about age fifteen onwards. to make matters much worse, this is how i feel about it, my sister was emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. not particularly me only, the other low self - esteem individuals in the household bore the brunt of her treatment, as well. her boyfriend the long - term unemployed drug user, her longest and oldest friend an alcoholic, another socially awkward pervert ( found weird porn on his computer - many fetish videos, etc. ) and gambling addict, and most importantly her daughter, my niece all received our fair share of abuse. what excuse was there for these adults to keep experiencing this treatment. extremely low - self confidence, esteem and self - worth, obviously. if anybody said anything that she didn't agree with, she would basically start yelling and arguing with them until they would cower in fear. that is the only way to describe her exacting process. i witnessed some pretty horrific arguments. the worst was and argument between my sister's boyfriend at the time and my sister. my sister's boyfriend got pretty angry ( not sure what the argument was ) and accidentally threw some keys in my sister's direction. she kept screaming at him to actually physically hit her or assault her. this must be her low self - esteem issues coming through, but, still, it was an extremely hostile situation. she kept egging him on to physically assault her, and saying she could "" handle it "" and she would "" take him on "". it's like she is attracted to these type of destructive relationships ( not the first - previous boyfriends acted similarly from what i recall, other boyfriends drug users, already married, mentally unstable, etc. ) to keep replaying narratives she holds about herself being unworthy and deserving of punishment. i'm not trying to make my family out to being "" defective "" or "" bad "" people so that i can emerge as the "" good "" or "" normal "" one. i am aware of this process, but i simply would be in denial not expressing my experiences. i feel my time with my sister which was from when i was fifteen until about twenty - three ( by that time i had long learned to escape emotionally from her shit ) caused destruction to my self - esteem, psyche and overall mental health. i'm recalling specifically the first few years with her. they were the worst, because i couldn't deal with her, being still, in my opinion, a minor in my mental capacity. still a child, really. it's not the fact that these things happened to me then that was traumatic. the trauma spurs from previous emotional abuse and assault from times before from my mother and grandmother. any emotional abuse whether it was withdrawing attention, emotion, arguments, hostility, overt anger, criticism, belittlement, humiliation, all reopened preexisting wounds from my childhood. the worst part of everything is the constant denial around this, i. e. her actions and actions of my entire family. she plays victim without acknowledging it. what is required is open recognition of these traumatic experiences. they occurred whether she or i like it or not and need to accept these things and learn to heal. my sister would constantly berate me for just holding an opinion on the contrary to hers. she is extremely erratic, still to this day, hostile towards disagreement and anybody who holds an argumentative position that is at antagonism to hers. she cannot receive criticism in any way. even if these things are benign such as cooking advice. things such as street directions. things such as conflicting opinions to hers regarding stories in the news. things such as contrary opinions on an analysis of another person's personality and why they behave a certain way. everything you could think of. she can't take criticism in any form and least of all ever from me. perhaps this is why i feel a lot of animosity towards her. i appreciate her taking me in when i was fifteen. i really had no place else to go. living with my mother may have been worse, but i guess i'll never know. i am fairly certain it would have been worse. my father didn't want anything to do with looking after me. i mean, what the fuck, dad. i did not deserve the treatment she gave me in return. she received money from my mother while looking after me, anyway. my dad would still purchase material goods for me, pay for school fees and the like. i felt spending those years living with my sister just kept tearing open my scars from childhood. the depression onset i experienced at 18 resulted in me going off a cliff into disaster. it's like every single person in my family either overtly or covertly told me, subconsciously or consciously, that i wasn't good enough. i was / am a bad person. i deserved bad things to happen to me. getting in trouble at school, with the law, getting in fights, failing at uni, all of these things i deserved. i understand my family primarily consists of individuals with low - self esteem and hence the motivation for projecting this onto others but it doesn't make it ok that it happened to me. all in all my sister was emotionally, verbally and almost sadistically inclined when taking things out on me. her work life was shit, she had a dead end job, and is a single mother, her daughter's father could care less about his own daughter and her. i was her mental / emotional punching bag as along with the others in "" her "" house, that she all too often referred to it as. i feel a lot of our differences are unreconcilable. we have an estate situation occurring that makes things worse. no legal recourse either at the moment. the trauma cycle continues. but now i do not stand for her arbitrarily hostile argument. i feel she is emotionally manipulative to get what she wants. guilt tripping my dad to singing the house over to her and me when he wanted to move away with his partner. she wants to "" share "" everything. her conception of sharing is one - sided. she wants me to pay for a house where i do not benefit. this is not legal or moral. this is tangental information i know but i feel relevant. i think i will have minimal contact with her from now into the future. she will never change. she will continue displaying the arbitrary abusive nature she has. she is co - dependent on other's addictions. she has hoarding problems. she keeps latching onto me like one of "" her "" possessions. she attaches value to possessions as she holds no value in herself. she doesn't value her self, only things. people are just pawns. i've tried to help her many times but she doesn't want the help ( helped cleaning, gave her books on psychology, etc. ). she will die early and due to her living unhealthily and chronically stressed. enough of her influence over me. my dad had the opportunity to leave. but he didn't. if he can't make the decisions for himself that's nobody else's responsibility. i will only ever pay what is legally required. she will try to bully me for the rest of my life. like she did as when i was a child. i don't want any of it. i will limit contact to when necessary. "" family "" what a misnomer for my situation. i hate that this is how it is for me. all the fucked up mentalities and world - view's of my blood but it is better to face the facts than deny what is really going on. i also vividly remember being made to cry by my uncle when i was doing mathematics when i was probably about eleven or twelve years old. we talk now, but still. it makes me angry he did that to me. i don't think he spoke to his own children like that. maybe, but, i can't be certain. i felt the anger was hatred for bringing "" shame "" to the family just for being born. the bastard child. the black - sheep children ( my sister and i ). i was thinking in the last year that perhaps i've never broken out of that shell of thought. constantly calling myself the bad guy and failure. struggling with self - esteem issues. battling extremely bad depression from about eighteen years old. still get it now but it is much more manageable. i've internalised a narrative, one that brands me as a bad person not worthy of love or affection. all my adult romantic relationships have burnt - out in this fashion. i leave the person first before they will leave me. being abandoned by my parents as a child and then emotionally abused and verbally assaulted by my caregivers as a child really screwed me up. then the abuse by my sister that ensued after this. i've found it more difficult than i thought that it would be living with my grandmother again. it must be all the past bad memories surfacing again. we clash often. it's hard to tolerate. i just don't say much to her now. that seems to be the best method, sadly. we still talk but it is limited. i know she cares for me still but it is kind of like a hate - poisoned love. that's the best way to describe it. things have improved dramatically in my life, though. i feel happier and at peace with all the things that have happened to me. i see them objectively now and don't attached self - blame anymore, like i used to do subconsciously. i was just a child. how was i supposed to know any better. i'm sorry if this is very long, if anybody actually reads this but i felt it was important i get this out. hopefully it is coherent and lucid. it is not too traumatic bringing up these past memories now because i've learned to work through them. i view them differently. i guess i achieved this through psychoanalysis and cbt techniques. i've only seen a university psychologist worker once for grief counselling. she told me i was coping fine so not to bother with returning to see her. i think this was probably pretty shitty advice, but hey. i feel she based her assessment on how i answered the question about suicide. which i lied about. she asked, "" have you thought about how you would kill yourself, "" i lied and gave an ambigious "" no "" response. i have in the past heavily considered suicide. self - medicating with drugs, alcohol and sex was a way, i feel, of self - harming or self - soothing these childhood wounds i discussed. i did think about killing myself before though at my lowest points and stayed up a few very long, insane nights, on the edge. i guess it is safe to say that music, art, beauty, friendship, knowledge and love saved my life. don't worry i'm not suicidal now. i do think about how i would do it from time to time ( very rarely now ). but, overall, i am at peace with my life now and want to leave my shitty past behind. my sister is still heavily destroyed by the ghosts of her childhood. she probably had it worse than me maybe. i can't be sure. she has a hoarding problem still. as did my mother. my dad has a gambling problem but seems to be managing better now. i can't change how they live their lives, although, i can provide my emotional support where possible. i do feel better after writing this. writing this has served the purpose of materialising my thoughts. it was therapeutic. any comments would be appreciated. sincerely yours,","2stlno","","5","0","1421578126","","-0.146536538462"

"survivorsofabuse","polly-esther","so how can i possibly process that new male male guilt? learned i am not getting the new only unwanted victim because well of avoiding my previous abuser.","i've shared my story before and at the time it was really helpful. things have changed quite dramatically since then and i'm struggling to process it all again so i thought i would have another try. i have reported my abuser to the police and have found it an amazing and positive experience so far. i am believed and have been supported by the officers in such a sensitive and honest way. being told by a police officer that they want to get him and will do everything they can to do so is an incredible feeling. so far he has been arrested and is on bail while the powers that be decide whether to charge him. such is the british judicial system, there is a lot of waiting involved. the main issue that's come from all of this other than putting my mother through learning the intimidate details of my abuse. is that it's been confirmed i am not his only victim. before he married my mum he had a previous wife, three daughters and a son. all three daughters went through a very similar experience to me. they reported when i was about 15 and i was questioned about an incident of indecent exposure by stepfather to me as a child. that event never happened and at the time i was still very much under his control though the abuse had stopped so i told the truth about the events i was asked about and chose to not say anything else. i hadn't realised then i was abused or anything like that and so thought it was the right thing to do. he wasn't charged and that they were lying became the consensus. since then it's been at the back of my mind but i've spent so long protecting myself and family from this i hid from it. it was safer for me to think it was only me. something about me made him do it and i was his only victim. with even an ounce of rational thought that argument is broken but it kept me safe for a long time. now it's gone. i'm safe now of course and i have so much support and love that i'm slowly dealing with this and can actually see my own progress. i expected set backs when i reported, i always knew it would make me flash back more and it would mean my mum would learn the details and my protecting her would be totally written over. i was prepared for them, i wasn't prepared for the monster i'd made my abuser to be an even worse one. i now question everything all over again, i am the reason he married my mum? he's a predator, who has there been since me? i've spent so much time and energy convincing myself that he did it only to me for some reason or another and it made it better. when i was the only one at least i was, well the only one. now i think i could have protected someone. it's all so much bigger than i thought. his daughters have been questioned and are willing to do whatever they need to in order to get charges pressed this time and i'm so grateful they will help. i feel so guilty they weren't believed before, i am dreading it if he doesn't get charges and for them it will be second time around. even their own mother didn't believe them i've since learned. all because of the manipulating creature my stepfather is. i really don't know how to process this and how to manage the guilt. guilt and shame are the buzz words of therapy and overcoming them has been my biggest triumph. it's changed my life to say it wasn't my fault but now this guilt feels more warranted and how can i not feel to blame for both not telling the police before and the fact i may have let another girl be abused.","2dt54u","","8","11","1408293639","","-0.013580952381"

many develop a swaggering, intimidating persona in an attempt to disguise their underlying fears, resentments, anxieties and unhappiness ) - truancy and poor academic performance ( 71 per cent of high school dropouts are fatherless ; fatherless children have more trouble academically, scoring poorly on tests of reading, mathematics, and thinking skills ; children from father absent from homes are more likely to play truant from school, more likely to be excluded from school, more likely to leave school at age 16, and less likely to attain academic and professional qualifications in adulthood ) - delinquency and youth crime , including violent crime ( 85 per cent of youth in prison have an absent father ; fatherless children are more likely to offend and go to jail as adults ) - promiscuity and teen pregnancy ( fatherless children are more likely to experience problems with sexual health, including a greater likelihood of having intercourse before the age of 16, foregoing contraception during first intercourse, becoming teenage parents, and contracting sexually transmitted infection ; girls manifest an object hunger for males, and in experiencing the emotional loss of their fathers egocentrically as a rejection of them, become susceptible to exploitation by adult men ) - drug and alcohol abuse ( fatherless children are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, and abuse drugs in childhood and adulthood ) - homelessness ( 90 per cent of runaway children have an absent father or children experience homelessness because of the single parents ability to provide ) - exploitation and abuse ( fatherless children are at greater risk of suffering physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, being five times more likely to have experienced physical abuse and emotional maltreatment, with a one hundred times higher risk of fatal abuse ; a recent study reported that preschoolers not living with both of their biological parents are 40 times more likely to be sexually abused ) - physical health problems ( fatherless children report significantly more psychosomatic health symptoms and illness such as acute and chronic pain, asthma, headaches, and stomach aches ) - mental health disorders ( father absent children are consistently overrepresented on a wide range of mental health problems, particularly anxiety, depression and suicide ) - life chances ( as adults, fatherless children are more likely to experience unemployment, have low incomes, remain on social assistance, and experience homelessness ) - future relationships ( father absent children tend to enter partnerships earlier, are more likely to divorce or dissolve their cohabiting unions, and are more likely to have children outside marriage or outside any partnership ) - mortality ( fatherless children are more likely to die as children, and live an average of four years less over the life span ) ( father - absence ) i must say that these concepts apply to absent mothers as well. it seems to compound these problems when the parent / s is absent by choice, at least perceived that way by the child. responsible parenthood involves commitment, self - sacrifice, integrity, and unconditional love. responsible parents are concerned with the well - being of their children, and their desire is to see their children succeed in all areas of life. a 2007 study by the university of guelph on the effects of father involvement gives compelling evidence of the positive and negative outcomes in the lives of their children. it specifically mentions how when children grow - up with their biological parents in a solid father - mother relationship the children thrive in their individual development. however, when either the mother and / or father is uninvolved, whether in a relationship with each other or not, the children have an increase in all aspects of developmental issues. the development of their children are also indirectly effected by how the father and mother treat each other. if in an abusive relationship the parents develop added stressors that debilitate her effectiveness for positive parenting. the study also shows evidence that mothers tend to be the gatekeepers in a fathers involvement with his children. ""... maternal gatekeeping was significantly, and negatively associated with the amount of father involvement. in addition, father competence was indirectly and directly linked to the amounts of maternal gatekeeping and father involvement with children with gatekeeping mediating the relationship between father competence and involvement. "" ( effects _ of _ father _ involvement ) the minority of parents out there who are successful in raising up whole, well adjusted individuals are the ones who have centered the foundation of their family on these principles : husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. “ children are an heritage of the lord ” ( psalm 127 : 3 ). parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of god, and be law - abiding citizens wherever they live. husbands and wives — mothers and fathers — will be held accountable before god for the discharge of these obligations. the family is ordained of god. marriage between man and woman is essential to his eternal plan. children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings ( unconditional love ) of the lord jesus christ. successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. by divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. in these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. extended families should lend support when needed. ( family - proclamation ) some will argue about the existence of a god who could allow such atrocities in our lives. the thing we don't consider is that part of our mortal learning experience is that we are given free agency. he warns us that our iniquities will effect our children for generations. if each generation has their own iniquities ( i. e. dysfunction, abuses, sins ) the cycle compounds and continues until finally someone figures out the problem and stops the cycle. the choices parents make in what kind of spouse they are, their commitment to their marriage, how they treat each other, how they fosters their relationships inside and outside of the family unit, their involvement and ability to be a productive member of their families and society all effects the cognitive, social, physiological, emotional, and spiritual development of their children. the deterioration of the family unit is a global crisis that effects the core values and development of our communities and cultures. i call for a plea to all fathers and mothers to take a stand and stop the cycle of creating broken children who become broken parents who create more broken children. look around you. the world is broken and this is why.","32ehas","","3","2","1428894606","","-0.0887677966102"

when i knew they hadn ’ t. and while i believe i never ran out of compassion or empathy, and always tried hard to do a good job, i never really understood. laura wilson and her mother teresa changed that for me. * * * * * * * * i met teresa wilson the day laura was murdered. as we stood in their beautiful home, surrounded by family photos, i felt very much the intruder, invading a grieving family ’ s most private moments. teresa, her oldest son paul and her youngest daughter sue sat with us as we explained what we knew and the charges we had laid. between breathless sobs and flowing tears teresa asked intelligent and insightful questions. she told us about laura, a beautiful and outgoing young woman. vivacious, with many friends, 23 year old laura had been raised in a loving, stable home. teresa spoke of laura ’ s life - long love of hockey and how when she could not find a team to play on she started and managed her own women ’ s team. we learned that only 10 months earlier laura had been the one to discover the body of her father, tony, after an apparent heart attack. * * * * * * * laura met the man who would ultimately take her life in high school. they had become friends and had dated for a brief time. in 2002, he contacted laura out of the blue and they rekindled their relationship and eventually moved in together. jealousy and possessiveness can sometimes be misconstrued as signs of love. but it was clear that laura saw something in this man that her family did not. she fell deeply in love and when teresa raised concerns laura staunchly defended him. teresa said that laura always saw the best in others. for two years laura became increasingly exposed to controlling and coercive behavior, isolation from her close friends, threats and severe intimidation, and ultimately physical violence. laura ended the relationship in november of 2004 and moved into her mother's condominium. unable to accept that the relationship was over, he made numerous calls to her home, work and cell phone. at first, he tried to work things out but when it became clear that laura had decided to move on the comments became abusive and demeaning. he would show up at various bars and restaurants where she would be with friends and where scenes were caused. he once came to her home in the middle of the night. through some of these very public and embarrassing incidents, laura steadfastly refused to acknowledge the concerns about this bizarre behavior. an extremely proud person, laura refused to admit that she was ever afraid of the man she once loved or that she needed help. on january 9th, 2005, after a night out with friends, laura and her close friend kim fleet were at laura's home. at about 4 : 00am, the man who once loved laura dressed himself in black, drove to her home, smashed in a front bedroom window and entered the home. he brought with him a knife which he used to stab laura multiple times. kim was also stabbed while trying to protect laura. she is only alive today by her split second decision to run for help. * * * * * * * * * on the day of laura ’ s murder, i interviewed her killer. he, who once made laura smile, was full of hate. for all of his bravado, it was his inability to handle rejection that was my only lasting impression. * * * * * * * * * after we were finished providing the information we knew, teresa told us that she would like to see laura. we were aware of the brutality of the attack, the nature of laura ’ s facial injuries, and we said that we didn ’ t think that it was a good idea - that she should not see her daughter that way. teresa insisted. the next morning, standing in the morgue, i watched as the attendant drew back the sheet and watched as teresa melted into herself, crying and whispering “ my baby …, my baby … ” tears filled my eyes and i struggled to remain composed. i could not speak... i could not think … i was not a police officer in that moment. i was a human being overwhelmed by an act that had caused indescribable suffering and incredible loss. over the next two years i came to know teresa, paul, his fiancee cari, sue and their extended family. in the face of unknowable sorrow, they remained valiant in their attempts to be strong and carry on. i also came to know kim fleet, a gifted ncaa women ’ s hockey player, who transformed by grief and sadness, became a former shell of herself. shouldered by her loving parents, her brother and sister, and buoyed by her close - knit network of friends, kim slowly grew stronger. sadness, the true debilitating kind, has been mostly a stranger to me. the death of my mother when i was in my early 20 ’ s was difficult but years of illness, i think, had prepared me to be resilient. when i met with teresa over the next few years, i came to understand what true sadness is. a woman with incredible faith in god, teresa always greeted me with a smile and a hug. i came to admire her intelligence, her strong convictions, her fairness and understanding of others and how they were dealing with their grief, her positivity, and the absolute unabashed love of her entire family. but while teresa tried to put up a strong front, our visits would always end in tears. her grief and despondence so overwhelming, she once slumped to her knees in distraught. * * * * * * on february 8, 2006, the court accepted a guilty plea to second degree murder. the man who had once loved laura was sentenced to life in prison without parole eligibility for 17 years. on the day of his sentencing, one of the most selfless acts of humanity i have ever witnessed occurred. teresa asked to speak to her daughter ’ s killer. she met with him in private and told him that based on her beliefs and her faith in god, she had forgiven him. she asked that he not waste what remained of his life and try again to become the man that laura had fallen in love with. and while she had forgiven, it was clear to all of those around her that teresa never stopped grieving the loss of her beautiful daughter and the life that she and her family could never have. * * * * * * on mar 11, 2007 teresa wilson died. there was no anatomical cause of death. “ died of a broken heart ”, i believe, is no longer a cliche. * * * * * * * the tsunami of emotion and devastation created on that january day has now slowed to a quiet, calm ripple that will never stop. and while i do not always get it right ( rarely is there an ability to unveil fully what goes on behind closed doors ), i think i now come from a greater sense of understanding and, most certainly, patience. frustration is now reserved for those who have the capacity to change their destructive behavior but don ’ t. it is the hope of laura ’ s family that by sharing their story that all of the “ laura ’ s ” of the world and all those who think they have a “ laura ” in their life, will seek support. perhaps it will be in the form of a phone call to your local abuse centre or hotline, to a women ’ s shelter, to the children ’ s aid society when young ones are in the home, to a knowledgeable friend or family member, or to the police. perhaps this never - ending, but calm wave, will ebb to your shore and change your life and perspective as it has mine. written by : detective darren couling london police service london, ontario ( written with the kind permission of the wilson family and kim fleet. you may freely share this piece. the author asks if you should use it as part of domestic violence training at your organization or institution that you please share that information with him at dcouling @ police. london. ca )","12uy8y","","11","1","1352388332","","0.00897916666667"

( note, this all happened a year or so ago spaced out into several months. ) is this there a way to turn my relatives around or should i see them as part of the problem? or do i have the wrong mentality about this? i ask this because i have a relative who is very dear to me that i want to see again and should i approach i will inevitably walk into a hornet's nest and even confronted by my abusers. my other problem is work. i cant hold the same job in public looking places anywhere for very long because im scared that my abusers will find me and passive - aggressively harass me me or just plain harass me while at work. what are my options for if something like this happens? im scared that they will prowl around my place of work and be in a position to mentally / emotionally abuse me, and for a supervisor do nothing because the situation isnt overtly sexual aggressive.","2dbht7","","10","4","1407832066","","-0.234715789474"
"domesticviolence","hmbgmooh","an open letter to almost everyone who even judges a common battered woman","november 19, 2014 i'll start this by saying, i never thought i would be the woman writing this. as i lay here and try to find a comfortable position for my head that's covered in knots, and a way to hold my fractured shoulder, i'm trying to remember how i let it get here. i've never identified myself as a feminist, and in all honesty, they disgusted me. i always thought they just hated the male race, they thought they were entitled, they let their men go hungry and their children be formula fed. because they were above taking care of their family. i could never understand it. i always wanted to take care of everyone else. however, last night my boyfriend ( who's basically my husband, or acts like it anyway ) went out drinking, and decided to drive home in my car. i say my car because it is mine. my name, my hard work to make the payments, my liability. he finally gets home, and i'm furious to say the least. so, i yell. i yell about his irresponsibility, his selfishness, his total lack of respect for my feelings or property. and boom, he hits me. i slap him. he throws me across the tile. he picks me up and repeatedly bangs my head on the ground ( knowing that i have medical condition to where that could kill me ). he twists my arms behind my back and pulls them, fracturing my right and pulling my left out of socket. he literally slung me against every corner and surface in my house, and pulled out a handful of my hair. then he spits in my face, and tells me i will never be his equal. i would like to add to this, that i'm 16 weeks pregnant, and have spent the entire day dealing with the blood from miscarrying in his child because of his abuse. i've never actually felt like i was going to die, but last night, my life flashed before my eyes, and i knew, he was trying to kill me. and he did. a part of me, at least, died from what he did to me, along with my unborn child. i now have a concussion, fractured rib, my entire head it bruised and knotted. my muscles in my calves are pulled from being drug across the floor, one arm is fractures, and one was pulled out of socket. so now i get to the real point, why i have stayed. i used to look at battered women and think "" just leave him! "" why was it so hard to run away and never look back? i now understand. when you're abused, you're not treated like a person. you're someone's property. he's taken all of my money, abolished my friendships, and tried to keep me from my family ( who hates him. ) he's led me to believe that nobody could ever want me. he's led me to believe that this is my fault, that i started this, that i made him do it. he's threatened my family, my friends, and anyone who's ever come between our relationship. he's hacked my phone, tapped my phone, and took control of my social networks. i had to start my own business because the abuse was so obvious when i worked in a public place. it's hard to leave. not because i love him or i believe he's really good, but because he's put the weight of the world on my shoulders. "" everyone i love will be safe as long as i keep my mouth shut and stay. "" i'm not a selfish person, like i said earlier, i have always wanted to take care of other people. so i take the abuse, mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, because i'm afraid of what will happen to those i love if i don't. i can write this now because even though it's been going on for over a year, losing my unborn child is still so fresh that it hasn't hit me, but has only angered me, and i know i won't be able to do this later. with that, don't judge the women who stay. don't get mad when they refuse your help. it might just be because they're looking out for you, and don't want to drag you into their own version of hell. until you've been there, you have no idea what we're going through. my eyes isn't black and my lip isn't busted ( this time ) but i'm hurting. i don't know how you can help me, i don't know where to turn. i'm lost, i'll admit that i'm lost. but don't call me weak. you have no idea how weak i really am, and how every piece of me is dying to be strong again.","2mqz8r","","5","3","1416378682","[new]","-0.0800344827586"

"survivorsofabuse","what_the_foxx","my sad story ( and long ) [ final trigger warning - includes mental / suicidal emotional / psychological abuse, sexual abuse ]","about a decade ago, i was in a bad relationship. over the course of two years, it was abusive in every way but physical. ( he never hit me, that i remember. ) it started when i was 17. it didn't start out bad. it was bit by bit, just gradually, that he manipulated me, so little at a time it may not have been noticed. it started with prom, and then dating. it didn't take long for the little twisted things to start. he would guilt me about spending time with my friends, saying it meant i didn't care about him. if / when i tried to break up with him, he threatened to kill himself. i was 17. i didn't know how to handle that. my parents were / are not the kind you can talk to about that sort of thing. eventually i didn't see anyone outside of school except my family, him, and the people he allowed me to see. he was very controlling, even just by his words. i don't remember when it happened, but i remember where i stood, when i'realized ', "" things would be easier / better if i just. stopped. thinking. "" and so i did. you know the little thoughts that run through your head throughout the day? mine were silenced. ( they still are not back to normal. i don't know if they ever will be. ) by the time sex was brought ( by his coercion ) to the relationship, i was pretty numb. if i tried to refuse, he would yell and yell and yell, and i felt there was no escape. i quit trying. thankfully, i went to college out of town. this did not mean things were immediately better. i didn't know anyone there, and didn't have a roommate for the first few months. he would call constantly, at any given hour, for various lengths of time. when we weren't on the phone, there were instant messages and emails. it was a major offense if i didn't come home on every possible weekend and holiday. he tried to convince me to move back to town and transfer to a college which was closer. he brought up marriage. but he also said, if i ever left him, he would pursue another local girl ( who looks very much like me ). i realize now this was in contrast to the threats, which had grown ( and never ended ), love and were no longer only of self - harm, but threats against others, including both physical harm and attacks on character. thankfully, i went to the event at the beginning of the school year which showcased many of the student clubs. i found one full of nerds, went to the first meeting, and continued to attend weekly. i found friends. good friends. and a roommate, who also became a good friend. by the spring semester, he had started'breaking up'with me, never for very long before he un - broke - up with me. the number of those events rose until it was multiple times a week, then multiple times a night. i couldn't take it anymore. i told people. i told my closest friends at school, and the few remaining friends at home. i had a veritable horde of nerds ready to stand by me. while at a meeting, surrounded by them, but without wanting to burden them with what i was doing, i broke up with him over im. i didn't want to wait another second. i wanted it over. and i didn't want to hear or otherwise deal with his reaction. he responded saying that he was going to kill himself. i informed his sister, with whom i had been friends, and advised her that she or a parent may want to do something, to call 911, but that i could not be a part of things any more. she understood. i'm sure i've left out things. during that time, i learned to forget. i don't remember most of that time of my life. i've struggled to be able to remember things since then. i can now maintain eye contact again - that ability had been destroyed in that time. i don't hide in big baggy clothes any more. i can wear t - shirts that aren't long sleeved - i can even wear shirts and tank tops, though i still feel weird about it sometimes. i've been working to get better. i've been to therapy. i've had supportive people in my life. i still have nightmares sometimes. not of him hurting me or anyone else, or really anything that would outwardly appear'bad '. i dream that we are together, or potentially going to be together, and that he is'normal '. it can be hard to talk about these things in - depth, and to do so seriously. for me, i've had feelings of guilt and stupidity, for not seeing things more clearly, for staying so long - and for'letting'things happen. i don't know what i hope to gain from writing this. maybe someone else will see this, recognize something in their life, and get out. maybe it's comforting to know you're not alone. i don't know. i do hope that others who have been in similar situations can hear what i've heard and learned - it's not your fault. please ask for help if you need it. there are people who will support you. it may not be easy, but your life can be so much better. tl ; dr - life sucks sometimes - but it's not necessarily your fault, and it can get better.","2d1mdw","","3","3","1407557489","","0.0464802469136"

"survivorsofabuse","ScifiEngineer","to question it about you dealing with emotionally manipulative parents.","long post warning ( i ramble when nervous i apologize, also kinda vague about things because i'm still nervous about talking about it ) : so, first of all let me explain my situation. i am 25 lived on the east coast with my parents for 18 years, went to college for 5, then moved back for 2 years. i graduated, tried to find jobs in the area around my parents ’ house ( mother :'it would be neat if you just lived here with us and the rest of your family, think of the money you will save!'), and went to grad school ( mother : ‘ grad school is a waste of time, money, and only gives you debt. ’ ). then this summer i planned on going to the west coast to meet up with a friend to look for job on the west coast. i told my parents about it to get their blessing / acknowledgment, and was met with an immediate "" i'll think about it "" or in my family's speak "" i'll say maybe until it passes so i don't have to say no "". i ask what the problem with the trip was and the three big things were 1 ) afraid i was going to be killed, 2 ) i was going to join a cult, and 3 ) i was going to move out there and never return. then over the course of the next week they start planning out the trip for me ( mother : ‘ you can go if you find a job first, then we need to pack you the right clothes ’ ). so about a month ago i left my parents ’ house on the east coast and moved to the west coast without telling them because i was scared and knew i would freak out if i talked to them about it. i had the money to leave and told my parents i would with or without their blessing, and once it started becoming “ their plan ” and not “ my plan ” i left without telling them. my brother ( 19 ) told them were i was going and not to worry. whelp, i get to west coast and i have an email from my father saying he is never going to talk to me again ( ‘ your past actions were selfish and childish ’ ), a call from my mother saying she is okay with the decision ( although my brother says she cries at the drop of a hat at anything and everything now ), and a shit - ton of passive - aggressive “ inspirational words ” from my father after he said he would never talk to me again. i just found this sub - reddit after moving to west coast and after reading through some of the materials and websites linked in the sidebar i think my parents might have been emotionally abusive to me and my brother, my mother specifically. my father ’ s typical weekday was wake up at 2 am, leave for work at 3 am, come home at 5 / 6 pm high or getting high, sleep for an hour until dinner at 7 pm, go to sleep at 7 : 30 / 8 pm. weekends were either work all day, sleep all day, or take us to a movie. he was a hands off dude ( ‘ i don ’ t do touchy feel - ly ; no hugs ’ ), but was physically imposing and never talked loud unless he was angry. but i can understand this because his mom walked out on his dad and siblings when he was little and this is kind of how his did raised him. my mom was by all outside observers the perfect mom, but was emotionally manipulative to us, and very controlling in everything we did ( not physically, but emotionally ). she had special way of doing everything, had me and my brother check - in and out of what we were doing, compared my brother to me ( ‘ why can ’ t you be like x ’ ; ‘ you should know better to act like that, that is something y would do ’ ), and was generally okay if you followed her rules, but if you stepped out she got angry. i understand this because i think she has been emotionally abused by her parents ( grandmother emotionally blackmails her still, and her father always put his money worries on her when she was little, and never lived in one place for more than a year before moving ). my brother has a lot better examples of what my mom pulled ; i was always quiet and just listened to what i was told to do. for example : he got arrested for dumb teenager things, the first thing mom said to him at the jail ( aside from yelling how big of a fuckup he was ) was her breaking into tears trying to figure out how to explain why he was in jail to the people ( parents and faculty ) at his school ; nothing about being okay or getting a lawyer or anything supportive. he has also been told multiple times by our father to not bring him into arguments as he isn ’ t allowed or can ’ t disagree with our mother so if he is pulled into discussions mom always win. anyway yeah. all that to ask, is it okay i avoid phone calls from my mom? i have talked to her a few times since i left and every time i get super anxious about the call beforehand, then after the call she makes me feel like what i did was all my fault and i ’ m crazy for being out on the west coast. but, if i avoid her calls she gets my dad ( the one who isn ’ t going to talk to me ever again ) to email me telling me, passive - aggressively, to call mom. i just don ’ t want to talk to her now, but if i know she is going to just make things worse for my brother ( he says the house is way worse than it ’ s ever been since i left ). * * tl ; dr : moved to west coast to avoid emotionally manipulative mother. don ’ t want to talk to her, but feel forced to by my emotionally absent father to talk to her and by myself as a means to help my brother. is it okay to avoid the calls and just email?

"". when i tell him that him swearing and yelling at us isn't okay, he says i can gtfo if it's such a big deal. so, what do you young guys think? like i said... i can't see it as abuse because the least abusive i have seen with people close to me is so much worse than that.","29101m","","4","3","1403667399","","-0.0627869565217"

','you're in third year now right? '. to the former, i put on a smile and say i did and to the latter i say how silly i was to leave before finishing the year so i have to re do it and they accept it as truth. as part of my agreement with my uni ive had to see various departments and have to continue seeing these groups throughout the year as well as occupational health screening regularly - - so it's been a really busy few weeks. at one meeting they forwarded the details of the psychological services, so i went ahead and fully answered the in depth questions they require when signing up. i went to the meeting assigned to me. the psychologist asked me more in depth questions, told me that no help would be offered to me, asked me some more questions, then asked me three specific questions that have been playing over and over in my head : have you managed to have sex? did you enjoy the sex? ( he then asked about my previous relationships to which, i replied, that my current partner was my only real relationship which led to ) - did you lose your virginity to your boyfriend? i was in shock, i muddled my words but was finally able to answer with my voice shaking. he then told me that my problems were to complex for them to deal with. i accepted his words, thanked him for seeing me, then walked off, trying my best not to burst into tears. what he asked and the way he asked them still make me feel really uncomfortable. ive relapsed into panic episodes and sleeplessness. sometimes, i will only see this man besides my abuser, other times, beside my old friends with the things they have said to me playing on repeat. today i saw an old friend ( at her request ), she jokingly called me slutty. and also had a go at me for being'rude ', and'awkward'to an old class his mate i had come across that assumed i went travelling in my gap year. also, proclaimed i had some sort of prejudice against my old classmates whilst we were on the train ( a lot of them have similar cultural and religious background ). tonight the speeches on repeat have been hers and the psychologists. its half 3am and i need to wake up early. im slutty. rude. racist. slutty. if i was really raped i shouldn't have sex. i shouldn't enjoy sex. i can't orgasm now because i feel disgusted with myself. there is no use in me complaining. i should have said to him that his questions made me feel uncomfortable ( violated ). i should have told her that seeing all of them makes me feel inadequate, i feel like a failure, they ask a lot of intrusive questions ( unknowingly ) that flare up my anxiety and put me in a negative mental state for several days afterwards.","2k25vv","","7","6","1414031994","","-0.129643243243"

', before she began to repeatedly punch me in the chest. it was then that i pushed her away and told her that it was over. she began to cry and apologise and beg me not to go before she sat at her door and wouldn't let me leave. eventually i got her to move, and i left. since breaking up, we have had a few conversations but i have ceased all contact now. recently, she has got a mutual friend of ours to upload a picture of her kissing other men to facebook as she couldn't do it herself as i have blocked her, told everyone that i'm the bad guy, and generally just been very nasty. i have not retaliated to any of those things and i did not respond when i received an email yesterday from her telling me she is seeing someone else. i'm glad that she is no longer part of my life, but now i don't sleep well, have had a constant knot in my stomach for a month, and i can't shake a sense of shame. i'm sorry for the length of this post, but it has helped me to get it all out. tl ; dr physically and emotionally abusive ex - girlfriend, would appreciated any words of support or guidance. any comments would be welcome. thank you.","192um6","","11","8","1361627743","","-0.107472972973"

"survivorsofabuse","jackiebird","found out something about being an old friend friend of mine","this isn't really a "" here's my story "" thing, nor a question, nor a call for advice. i really just need to talk about something somewhere i feel is safe. a little bit of back - story first to establish things. i grew up in an abusive home ; dad beat and belittled me on a near - daily basis and my stepmother engaged in emotional torture and sexual harassment. when i was 11 - 12 i was periodically molested by a neighbor who looked after me when my usual sitter was unavailable, before i got latch - keyed. a guy named steve ( that's his * * real * * name, and you'll understand why ) was one of my best friends growing up. he, myself and another friend of mine who i'll call beth ( * * not * * her real name, and again, you'll understand why ) hung out all the time. we called him by his middle name, paul, because he was named after his father / grandfather and it helped to differentiate them. beth sometimes called him paul - iwog ( like'polliwog'), which he didn't like so she only did it when she wanted to tease him, or get him to do something for us, like chaperoning us when we wanted to play beyond the confines of our immediate neighborhood. my father didn't like me being friends with him because he was three years older than me, but my father also didn't like me having friends period. i also always got the sense that paul was slower than kids his age ; he didn't have friends, he didn't go to public school after elementary school, he was awkward and gawky, liked weird nerdy things like i did and always hung out with kids younger than him. i always figured that our ages might have been different, but our mentalities evened out. so between the ages of nine and fourteen, paul was pretty much the only male in my life i thought i could trust. i went to him a lot for solace from what i went through at the hands of my father and neighbor. we'd go exploring in the woods, and he'd bring his collection of shuriken and knives to throw at paper targets, and showed me how to follow animal tracks. he introduced me to the * doom * games, and showed it me photoshop for the first time. we used to go into the pipes connecting the community lakes and talk for hours, he'd show me his * magic the gathering * cards ; i didn't like to play but i loved the artwork. he'd tease me about liking * beast wars * instead of the "" real "" * transformers *, but still pat me on the shoulder when i cried when dinobot died. he'd invite me over for dinner all the time and i'd talk to his mom about books and philosophy and she taught me about religions outside of what i was raised with. he'd come over sometimes when i got home from school and helped me do my homework and clean the house before dad and stepmother got home so there'd be one less thing for them to yell at me about. looking back, he was the one guy who pretty much saved men for me. if it weren't for him, i'm pretty sure i'd have turned into a man - hating shut - in, between my father and my neighbor. being away from paul was one of the hardest things about deciding to move away from my father and in with my mom when i was 14. he was probably the first person i loved. now i'm 26, and over the years i had kept in touch with beth, though paul fell off the radar when he went into the usaf ( he enlisted soon after i moved ). so i was happy when about 3 years ago he contacted me out of the blue. i wanted very badly to start up a friendship again, but right off the bat there were problems. to sum it up, he professed to being in love with the version of me he knew back then, but wasn't able to accept the person i'd grown up into. he flew off the handle and insulted me whenever i asked about his personal life, or when i talked about mine. he'd frequently bring up an ex that apparently did something bad to him, but he'd never tell me what and he'd get upset if i asked to know what happened, calling me a whore for "" being too forward. "" i tried for 2 years to remain his friend and behave in a way that made him comfortable, sure he was dealing with some sort of mental problems, or even ptsd ( even though he'd never seen combat and worked on programming, but i figured the military could still be really hard on someone as sensitive as i remembered him being ). but the friendship was becoming bitter, and i couldn't hold his hand anymore, pretending to be someone i wasn't. i didn't want to let him guilt me over the fact that i grew up into someone i actually liked so he could indulge in some "" ideal - woman "" fantasy. that wasn't fair to either of us. so we mutually split ways. it was hard, but i thought it was necessary ; let us part ways with our happy memories intact before we ended up hating each other. and for the last year or so i was content with that. so imagine my sadness when a few days ago, beth shows me these two articles : [ link 1 ] ( http : / / www. gazette. net / article / 20120530 / news / 705309394 / bowie - man - sentenced - to - seven - years - on - child - pornography - charges & amp ; template = gazette ) and [ link 2 ] ( http : / / www. capitalgazette. com / bowie _ bladenews / news / bowie - man - gets - seven - years - in - child - porn - case / article _ 765dce50 - 440a - 5a1a - b60c - 12c5787bbd58. html ) i've dealt with repressed memories before, but i've never dealt with memories that were happy at the time, and are now smeared with a heavy, greasy filth. i'm putting pieces together, remembering small things from childhood that make me nauseous to think about now. he carried a camera with him everywhere, always taking photos of beth and i. never anything bad, but always snapping pictures that he never let us see. there were cameras in his house too ; old camcorders on tripods in his room. they made me nervous because i could never tell if they were on or not, but they always seemed to point at me. i'd visit him and we'd watch tv, and he'd always insist on sitting behind me at his computer desk. if i turned around to see how he was, he'd start fumbling and tell me not to look at him, saying things like "" don't you trust me? "" i remember one time when i was 10 i turned around and saw a tent in his pants, and with my rudimentary 6th grade knowledge of sex i got nervous because i thought i was supposed to do something about it. i wanted to leave, but he begged me to stay, and he explained why it happened, in more detail than my parents or school ever gave me. it stopped being a big deal, and what's weird is that it actually became something we joked about over the years. there's been questions and guilt running through my head all the time ever since. did he have these inclinations back then? is that why he befriended beth and i? what did he feel when i sobbed into his shoulder? are there photos of beth and i in one of those folders he shared? a folder labeled "" vintage "" or would we still be categorized by age? or were we part of a private collection? he probably could have gotten me to do anything he wanted, so would he have taken advantage of that if he'd had the chance? could i have done something? there were things he said when we rekindled our friendship that i feel like should have been huge tip - offs that something was wrong. ways he dodged questions and comments he'd made. he admitted that he never called child services on my behalf because he "" wanted me to need him. "" he said he hated when i talked about my relationships because he thought it made me "" tainted, "" and that he wanted to think of me as a still - innocent child. the idea of me being sexually active before marriage ( and at all ) infuriated him, and many times he told me i deserved my string of abusive relationships before my current one ( a healthy relationship i've been in for 7 years ), that i deserved to be treated badly by men, because i gave in to baser desires. he said many times that he hated the idea of adult relationships, because it makes people stupid ; they turn into lust - driven zombies. he wished people could stay children forever. i feel like if i'd been smart enough, or hadn't brushed so many things off, i would have been able to do something years ago and this could have been stopped sooner. he says he loved me as i was, as a child, and he wanted to be with me back then. so there's the one sick thought that's flitted through my head that i know isn't true but i can't shake ; * could i have caused this? * the altruistic side of me wants to say that the news of this hasn't broken me, or taken anything away from my past. and i honestly do still cherish the memories and am grateful for the time i had with him and how he was able to help me. he gave me a lot of strength whether he knew or intended it or not. nothing has changed and life will go on as it's always been meant to. but there's also a part of me that wants to look him up, find out where he is and visit him. just to look him in the eye and ask him my questions, say everything i've said here, as well as some other choice words. i want to make sure he understands what it means to me that the one person i thought was helping me against my abusers was just a budding abuser himself. make sure he understands why what he did is wrong. i want to tell him how stupid and betrayed i feel. i know a lot of this has seemed self - centered in a "" big - picture "" matter, but these are my honest feelings and just needed to put them out there, out of my own head. thank you, anyone who read.","x0ydb","","10","2","1343065937","","0.04098"

"domesticviolence","linacatt","here again is my ( since 19 / 20 f ) story and here is my job advice.","this is going to be a long post. i never though i would wind up in a situation like this and that as soon as it happened i would be gone, but i was brain washed and manipulated. i was 16 years old, and i met a guy called oliver, he was 20. at first he tried to make me seem like the dominating one, by adoring me, loving everything about me, wanting to know everything about me, my past, my family, my dreams and my goals. i was idolised by him. he used to call me "" angel "" and treated me like one. after dating for 3 months i moved out of home ( due to relationship issues with my parents - which are now better than ever ), at the age of 16 into a sharehouse with oliver. he used to say how i was always better than him, because i completed highschool and had a job like him, as if he appreciated me and wanted me more than anything. then, once he got to know me and adore me, he told me his secrets, goals and desires and that he was physically abused by his father. at first it was a lot of verbal fights 5 - 6 months after living together. he'd punch holes in walls and swing bats into metal poles in the basement, but he never touched me. then fights became more frequent, he'd control whether i wore makeup, who my friends were, who i could see and when, he'd search my phone, my laptop, control what i wore and even when i worked. then threats of violence. i remember the first thing he did, i was stressed and he used that as an excuse to choke me, and bang my head on the wall. it slowly became more physical, little stuff such as pushing me into walls, or pulling me off the bed, slapping me or spitting on me. then things got worse and worse, quicker and quicker. choking, biting me, threatening to kill me. he'd cheat on me, again and again and again. he would hurt me during sex. he would ignore me when he was got home from work, making me desire him more than i should. he would always make it up to me, massage me, buy me gifts, adore me again. i always came back. at first the police didn't believe me. it took me 3 - 4 attempts until a domestic violence order got put in place. i tried to leave him and he threatened suicide. that's when police took action. since the police took action, we have been on and off for about 8 months. physical abuse, verbal abuse, cheating, you name it. death threats and suicide threats. he would never support me when i was upset. he would call me every day or demand i called him multiple times during the day. he would stalk me. i tried to convince him for months to go to counselling or relationship therapy with me, he promised. i paid for a $ 150 appointment for him not to show up. until one day i got his verbal abuse ( telling me to go kill myself, calling me a whore, an idiot, telling me he cheated on me, then begged if i made him leave my house he would kill himself, him banging on my door, and more ) on recording and showed it to the police. since than a temporary no contact has been put in place, but he still calls once in a while with a private number or follows me at university ( since he enrolled there ). i lost all my friends due to him. i nearly lost my family and i nearly lost my life. i wound up in hospital. he knew i was dependent on him as i lived with him, i felt i had no escape. i thought he loved me and i was doing something wrong, but this is not love. this was disguised as love. i was so scared to leave because he had controlled me to the point where i almost had no one, i was scared to be alone. after being together for two and a half years, i left him. it's been three weeks since i've contacted him, i've ignored him at uni, ignored his phone calls and i go to the police every time he does anything. i'm starting to make new friends, wear what i want i feel free, enthusiastic, motivated and happy. i go to court in two weeks, as he has decided to plead not guilty to his breaches despite hard evidence. therefore i must show up to show my evidence and make another statement. here is my advice to all of you... the first sign of domestic violence is when he / she highly idolises or adores you, seduces you and makes you feel special. then, the second sign is when they isolate you. 1 ) if controlling behaviour gets out of control, such as he / she controls what you wear, when you go out and even when you work, watch out. 2 ) fighting every week is not normal. 3 ) if he / she hits you, pushes you, spits on you or whatever else - it is going to happen again. 4 ) go to the police. i know it's intimidating, i let things happen multiple times before i even thought about calling them. 5 ) do not, no matter what allow yourself to wind up with no one but him / her. 6 ) get a recording app for your phone. if you have any questions please ask.","2em6uf","","6","6","1409050198","[new]","-0.0945029850746"

"survivorsofabuse","gpak1021","the anger is brewing, how would do ed i handle al this?","i have absolutely no idea how to formulate this, so my apologies in advance if i'm not doing this right. i will get right to it, because this is starting to leak into my marriage. growing up, my mother left my father when i was 5 years old, and i can still remember feeling confused about what was going on seeing all the boxes all over the room and being told we were "" going on vacation "". some facts about the reality of that situation was that my father had giving up hard drugs once i was born, and this was a result of him relapsing and beating my mom. two years went by, i am now 7 years old and my mom meets someone. gradually she begins to stay over at his home more and more, and we ( my younger sister and i ) move into his home. my memory is hazy as to how and when i began to get beat during this mans drunken and sometimes sober episodes, but it began at i believe the age of 8 - 9. i can still remember feeing so depleted about who i was as an individual and that i could not formulate any reason as to why this was happening to me and no one else ( my sister ). there would be times out in public when we would go out to eat at a restaurant, and at the time i was learning how to read, and this man would make me read aloud the menu items, and when i could not pronounce the items properly he would audibly humiliate me in front of everyone. the random beatings increased as i got older, ( this lasted from 8, 9 years of age all the way to 12 - 13years old ) and so did the awareness of the situation as it really was. i began to notice that my mother had full knowledge of what was happening, all these years, and did nothing about it. i cant remember a time in my childhood where i felt like it was ok to be myself. i used to consciously analyze how i thought these people perceived me and i still do to this day, if not more than i ever have. some things have happened in my present day life ( 23 years old now, married ) such as my beloved grandmother passing away back in may. what im getting at is that her death, the death of someone who rescued me from that terrible man during my childhood and who always loved me is no longer apart of my life, and it is beginning to force me to look at my childhood and address it. being married for these short 6 months or so, i have begun to lash out at my wife verbally and on my animals, and i am afraid that i am picking up the same behaviors that was afflicted onto me as a child. the anger from my grandmother's passing is starting to blur with my childhood, which makes me think it is a mirror or some kind? make no mistake i have no delusions about me dealing with any of these situations in a healthy manor, but i know this is the root cause of my anger lately, and i am out of ideas as to cope with this. i love my wife more than anything, and i am sick to my stomach that i treat her with such disrespect when she is trying to get me to see the light. im sorry if this is the wrong forum to be posting this type of thing on, but i'm at the end of my ropes. any thoughts, questions or concerns would be gladly appreciated. thank you.","1z2kqz","","4","1","1393488822","","-0.0907846153846"
"domesticviolence","Kat24","but this doesn't happen to many women... like me... need that input","i am 30 years old, and a mother of two. i'm successful. i'm educated. i have a wonderful career. my children adore me. i've been married for 6 years to a man that, if you met him, you'd find instantly attractive and likable and nice. about two years ago, i became very bored in my marriage. my husband had trouble keeping a job, he complained a lot, he didn't follow through on things. i traveled a lot for work and worked very hard. the travel led to me starting a relationship with another man. i was able to keep it secret for several months, but then my husband found out while we were on a vacation. when he found out he punched a hole in sheetrock. because of the demands of my work travel, getting divorced seems so daunting. how would i manage the travel and the kids? on top of this, this is my second husband, and i share custody of my first son with my ex - husband, who is always looking for reasons that i should see my kid less. i put off divorcing. a few more months pass. i keep the affair going. my husband will from time to time find hints of the affair, and lose his temper. one time throwing a glass. another time shoving me, then throwing me against the garage door. a few more months pass. at this point, it seems my husband has moved on as well. i find evidence he is having an affair with a 25 year old. there is a confrontation. he starts yelling. i don't want him to go downstairs where my four year old is and scare him, so i put myself between him and the door. he throws me on the bed. we're struggling. he puts his hands on my throat and is choking me. i kick him off. he slaps me across the face. i stand up, he shoves me down and i hit my head on the nightstand. he throws my bag down a flight out of stairs, then takes my ipad out of it and bashes it agains the stair railing about 12 times. then he tries to take my son in the car with him. i follow, calling 911. we struggle in the car. the police come. he denies choking me. he denies his affair with the 25 year old. and now here i am, just a few days later. sitting at my desk in my corner office . wearing nice clothes. still not able to believe this has happened to me. i keep running the scenario over and over in my head. i keep telling myself it was a function or provoking him. i also tell myself that society has placed subjective values on pain. i caused him 18 months of emotional pain with my affair. why is that okay? it was probably more pain than what he physically inflicted during our fight. i keep wanting to pretend it never happened. i keep questioning that it did happen, because he denies portions of it. i feel crazy. i feel like i need to simplify my life, end the affair, quit my job, stop the work travel, go into counseling, and fix this whole thing. i don't trust myself. i've never felt so clouded. everything i read about dv doesn't seem to apply to me. we are both educated. we have plenty of money. we don't drink or use drugs. am i really a dv victim, or is this just one really bad fight? i asked that the charges be dropped. am i stupid? i'm not really all that hurt. just some bruises and soreness. i'm not even sure what i'm asking the group to give me feedback on. it sounds so cliche, but i do believe i caused this by cheating. i don't think he would have ever done this had i not cheated.","1gp5ht","","5","13","1371692302","","-0.0971028571429"

"domesticviolence","dreamsofnight","she f 21 appearing here in criminal court this march against... my physically and and sexually abusive m a 21 ex. or how do i get through it?","tl ; dr - i'm the witness against my ex for rape and assault with intent to injure. worried about cross examination and feel like i'm the one on trial. also worried about seeing him and what im going to feel since i still hold on to a part of the relationship. hi so i'm due to go to court in march about a year and a half from leaving my abusive ex. ( although it still feels like yesterday ) a bit about my situation. i was with him for a year and a half. the physical abuse started about 6 months in and there was verbal / emotional abuse earlier in the relationship. the abuse escalated quickly once we moved in together turning to pretty frequent beatings and some strangulation. it was usually brought on by him asking me for money and me refusing. he was in a fair amount of debt and would want money daily so he could buy weed and fast food. this later got to the point were he would beat me until i gave him my efpos card and told him my pin ( which i changed several times to try and stop him taking my money ). he was also very sexually demanding and would be very upset or angry if i didn't want to have sex especially if it was more than once in a week. he was a virgin before me ( which he lied about ) and i wasn't so he was very angry that i had other partners and he had to know that no one could ever of beat him by going further with me than him. this often meant him forcing me to do things i didn't like doing sexually his justification being if i had tried it with another guy why would i not do it with him who i was meant never to love. anyway this all escalated in the last month or so of our relationship where he raped me 3 times and held knives up to me when i said i was going to leave him and once even tried to bind me up with duct tape ( which was particularly terrifying as we had watched one of those murder investigation shows the night before and the girl was killed in the same way ). i managed to just talk him down these times but i think they were at he point where i wouldn't have been able to if i went home to him one more night. so i went to the police it was all a blur i was kind of in a zombie like state where i don't remember making any decision to leave him or go to the police it was just like i was on auto pilot. so i gave my statement via a filmed interview about 2 - 3 hours long. tried to get through everything i could but its hard to remember everything when there was so much. especially as he had raped me the night before then tried to kill himself - which i talked him out of. sorry this is a long read i kind of find it hard to explain simply. anyway for court i'm nervous about a couple of things : 1 ) in out relationship we had a word lets just say it was'sandwich'which we would say to make sure the other wasn't lying. this was also a safe word for when we would sometimes role play in bed. i didn't mention this to the police because i just honestly didn't think of it and now they are using it as his defence for the rapes saying it was role play. i know i'm a complete idiot for not mentioning it. i said it every time he raped me but i just didn't think to say it to the police. even his mother is saying she knew about it which isn't true. i'm worried because i feel like i'm on trial and it means i have to talk about our sex life which just feels like being abused all over again. 2 ) i'm worried about seeing him. some of the time its fear and i sometimes feel like im still in love with him. i know that is really screwed up and theres no excuses for his actions ect but i can't help but hold on the the side of our relationship that was so great. i've never felt so accepted by someone so close to them or so in love. i know it probably wasn't healthy or real but i can't let go of that feeling. i have a new partner now who is lovely but i don't feel things on that same level. i love him but its no wear near as deep and i don't feel so close to him. anyway sorry for the novel. any advice would be really apreciated. tia","2uikaj","","3","8","1422885100","[new]","-0.110692857143"

"domesticviolence","dvthrowaway123","frequently feeling like threatening my business partner [ h 20, f ] anyone is actually trying to the bait off me [ 19, f ] into physical violence. don't even know what then to do.","for some context, we've been together for about nine months and are currently living together. i have an extensive history of csa and sexual violence + was in an abusive relationship for ~ 2 years prior with a man, whereas she comes from a household where intimate partner abuse has always been pretty normal. the abuse she faced as a child was mainly emotional ( on behalf of her mother, who was battered ), and she was never the target of her fathers physically abusive outbursts. she's also approximately 8 "" shorter and 70 pounds less than i am, so there is a very drastic disparity in terms of physical strength. my biggest problem when attempting to restrain her in the past ( i've had to a few times ) was ensuring that i didn't unintentionally hurt her. when there's been instances where i've feared for my physical safety or was having ptsd flashbacks to being raped as a direct result of her aggressive actions, i left bruising on her wrists and arms when restraining her and she has carried on a bit about being "" battered "". i couldn't tell whether or not she was joking about it ( in that situation i had no idea what i was supposed to do & amp ; did the best i could to make it stop w / o doing anything that was aggressive back - - i was having tremendous flashbacks to being raped and had already attempted to make it very clear that i didn't want her near me or touching me in any way, she just didn't listen ), but she did seem pretty in denial about her instigatory role in it all. for the past few weeks, it's seemed that at any point in time in which we argued she's attempted to escalate the situation - - at least from my perspective. up until now i've always been able to remove myself from the situation & amp ; calm down before i lashed out in any way. i've never been a physically violent person ever, but i find myself constantly considering striking her now when we fight. for obvious reasons, it makes me incredibly uncomfortable & amp ; anxious. i love her and don't want to ever hurt her in any way. i don't want to think i could ever be that normal kind of person, either. she taunts me, takes my belongings ( namely my phone or laptop ), and belittles me frequently when we fight. the berating and back & amp ; forth will usually go on for upwards of twenty minutes. a lot of the time it feels like grade school bullying, with her doing things that are very teasing and maybe otherwise not that serious, yet overwhelmingly inappropriate & amp ; malicious in a situation where we are arguing. she laughs as i become angrier and more distressed by her actions, and a lot of the time it's like she's trying to goad me into having some kind of outburst. when i attempt to address the situation calmly, she'll behave in away that's meant to be inflammatory. a week ago, she wrapped herself around me in bed when we were fighting after i made it extremely clear i did not want to be touched. as i was getting up out of bed to leave the room completely, i pushed her away from me using more force than necessary. she's bought this up a few times, bringing it up most recently yesterday morning when we got into an argument that led to her slapping at me. when she said i hurt her restraining her ( i pinned her to the bed for a few moments so that i could get up and leave ), she said that she didn't hit at me very hard at all & amp ; that there was no way she had hurt me ( the place where she hit me was actually pretty sore once the adrenaline wore off ). i don't know what to do. a lot of the time when we fight that way it seems like it might be fulfilling or even pleasurable to lash out at her physically, to channel the anger she's inspiring in some formidable way with my fists. she's so adept at pushing my buttons & amp ; at belittling my feelings when i express myself verbally that it sometimes seems like the only way to get a point across in the heat of the moment. i don't want to hit her or hurt her in any way, though, and know rationally that that's not true. i don't want to be an abuser or a wife beater. the idea of it scares the shit out of me. on the other hand, i also feel like she manipulates me a lot when we're arguing because of the height / weight disparity that creates such a clear imbalance in terms of physical exertion. a few weeks ago she also admitted that she wanted to see if i would ever physically hurt her. i recognize through all of this that neither of us are completely innocent. we've both always done things to instigate arguments and perpetuate them as we're both heady and strong willed - - which has been frustrating, but otherwise not too big of a deal up until this point. i'm worried that her actions paired with my feelings will eventually culminate in my injuring her and i don't know how to address what's going on. if anyone could offer advice or guidance, i'd really very much appreciate it. reaching out to this sub, in this way, is really nerve wracking for me & amp ; i hope people realize that i mean no offense. i'm just not sure what the fucks going on right now in my relationship, it scares the shit out of me, and i'm in desperate need of help.","29jzvb","","3","2","1404214369","[new]","-0.120080434783"

"survivorsofabuse","NumbLover","sexually physically abused as a young child, raped by at home 21. although i fear having sexual sex... with my loving soul partner. [ trigger warning ]","i am a 24 year old female. i was sexually abused when i was very little by my mothers step father. i don't remember a lot of it, because i think i blocked some of it out. sometimes i'm not even sure if some of it happened, because i can't remember big chunks of my childhood. i think it started when i was about 18 months to 2 years old. it stopped before i started school. but i can't remember anything much from age 6 to 11. i became extremely depressed at around 7 or 8 years old, something that i see as being mainly a genetic fault, due to most people on my father's side of the family having lifelong depression. i had extreme anxiety, both social and fears of irrational things. i began seeing a psychologist who put me on anti depressants when i was 9. i have been on them ever since ( i've tried many different types and doses, and i think it's as good as what it will ever be now ). i didn't tell my psychiatrist for many years about what happened. when i first had sex at 19, i felt like i had to do it to make him happy. i didn't know how to say i wasn't ready or that i was scared, so i just let him do it. i also just wanted to be like everyone else. that's not his fault, it's mine. what is his fault is that he didn't tell me that he had herpes, and even though he did wear a condom, he gave it to me the first time we had sex. i didn't want to date him really, but i ended up falling in to it because i felt like i didn't have any other option. i felt resigned to it. but after a year i was becoming increasingly unhappy with how immature he was, so i ended it. about a year after this, i was raped by a guy i had been to school with for many years, who i thought i was safe around. we were in a pub and he put something in my drink. i remember some things, like him helping me outside, and the cold wind hitting my face. i woke up in the middle of him raping me. i remember vomiting everywhere and crying because of the pain. i remember how he spoke to me and spoke the things he called me. i woke up and i was naked and i felt so ashamed that he had seen my body. i know i have a pretty bad figure, so it was like an added pain. i never reported it. i felt responsible for trusting him. i felt responsible for putting myself in to a situation where it could happen. i knew that he had asked me out because he was looking at something more than being friends, and i was flattered and went with him. so i feel like i am to blame for a lot of it. i know it sounds pathetic to say, but i was so horrified and ashamed that he saw me naked. i hate my body. i think if i were a thin attractive person i would have had more confidence in reporting it, but as i am overweight i almost felt / feel sometimes that i should have been grateful that someone saw me as a sexual object. i became more nervous and depressed, and i also became more open to sex. i willingly had sex with several men, and i think it was because it's easier to be up for it than to have it taken from you. i also felt like i desperately wanted to please people and have them like me. i tried having a relationship with someone who i thought a lot of at the time, but we only dated very briefly as he cheated on me. i stopped working because i felt like i couldn't cope. i felt like i was not good enough to be around other people and that i would never be able to make anyone happy. i had some new treatment for depression which involved magnetic pulses being sent through to my brain. it helped me a lot. i became a lot more calm and i felt i could think much more clearly. i met a wonderful man who treats me really well. he knows about my past and accepts it. he really wants to help me. but now, when we have sex, i feel scared. more scared than i ever felt with other consensual partners, and i am not sure why. is it because i am in a stable relationship now, and i have time to process what happened and compare it to what sex should be like? i feel like having sex is a duty. i feel like it's something i have to do. my partner is so understanding and doesn't ever push me, but i feel so guilty that i can't give him what he needs. i have never had an orgasm or any pleasure from sex whatsoever. i have more feeling from scratching my knee. the only feeling i have aside from a pushing and pulling feeling, is the occasional twinge of pain. if i masturbate ( which i have no interest in ever doing ) then the best i can get is a very slight flutter that lasts about half a second. i know i clearly have issues with sex. but what do i do about it?","33tfzf","","8","4","1429968792","Possible Trigger Warning","-0.029823880597"

"survivorsofabuse","sheikhyerbouti",""" but that you'don re a great guy... ""","when i was four years old, a 17 - year old babysitter loosened her clothing and encouraged me to touch her exposed breasts and vagina. she said it was so i could see what grown - ups looked like. i was too young to know whether what happened to me was wrong or not. but in retrospect i do wonder what effect it had on my emotional development. at age eight, a different female babysitter would strip my clothes off in front of my younger brother and lock me outside the door of my own house - in broad daylight. i know for a fact that it had a profound negative effect on my emotionally. considering some of the previous trauma i had experienced before when i was younger, my emotional state was already pretty fragile to begin with. my brother told our parents what had happened and for the rest of summer, a girl from our church would babysit us. because the now - former sitter lived just down the street from us, every now she would pass by on her bicycle and hurl insults at me if i was playing in my front lawn. again, i didn't know what i had done to make her angry at me, but i stopped playing in the front yard from then on out. at age 18, my parents had the opportunity to move out to eastern washington, an area i detested ( and still do ). i was bound and determined to stay in the portland area and the woman i was dating ( who was 9 years my senior ) offered to take me in. almost immediately after my parents had moved away my girlfriend would start emotionally and physically abusing me. anything would set her off, and when she got angry, it was my fault. at one point she threw a full - sized box spring down a flight of stairs at me. all throughout her tirades she would rail on about how she had been physically abused as a child, and later would be in abusive relationships ( that also ended up exposing her daughter to sexual abuse as well ). i had no intention of hurting her or her daughter, but the only way i could demonstrate my honesty again was to let myself be subjected to abuse. eventually our relationship would devolve to the point where the only kind of physical affection i could get out of her was in some form of abuse or neglect. her idea of sex was to have me help her masturbate to climax, after which she would turn over and fall asleep. any time i asked for some kind of physical interaction, i would be told that i was constantly asking for sex. after three years of constant debasement, i came to the realization that i had the resources at my disposal to leave that relationship and i quickly did so. this is the first time i've actually opened up about my past history in a public forum. one of the reasons i've been reluctant to do so is because whenever i mention being abused or molested to someone individually, the reaction is invariably one of the following : "" you were too young to have it do anything damaging to you. "" "" don't think that by making shit up you've had the same abuse happen to you. "" or my favorite : "" but you're a guy, didn't you like it? "" it's the same dismissive attitude that people reserve for other victims of sexual assault and rape. i always take the subject of rape seriously and refuse to joke about it. but i won't have someone tell me that being coerced to touch a woman's genitals at a young age should be a positive experience. i also fail to see how it makes any difference that the person throwing insults, punches, and sometimes furniture at me was my girlfriend, and not my mother or other authority figure. what further rankles is how often i've been subjected to emotional and physical abuse at the hands of those who themselves have been abused and are blind to the circle of violence and loathing that they are now making themselves party to. i'm not posting this for any kind of attention - positive or negative. i'm also not here to make some kind of misogynist statement about the iniquity of the female gender. if anything, what my experiences have taught me is that you don't need a y chromosome to be a maladjusted prick. but i can no longer keep this inside me any longer and feel that only by bringing this vein of darkness to the fucking light i can find a way of working with it. having said that, if you think that disregarding my experiences outright is going to suddenly undo them and make me shut up, you've got another fucking thing coming.","22b7he","","14","3","1396745197","","-0.228712195122"

"survivorsofabuse","inmy30s","i ( sort of ) always stood that up for a stupid fellow victim","sorry, this is kind of a long story : i have been involved in martial arts on and off from age 14 ( i am now 32 ). my school, where i basically grew up, is sort of like a family in a way. one of the main guys there, who has been there longer than me, i've loved like a brother my whole life. i now live on the opposite side of the map, but about a year ago, i found out that one of his ex - girlfriends, this super cool girl, was living on this side as well. we reconnected and i found out she has been dealing with numerous diseases and conditions due to a bunch of things that have happened in her life, since i had last seen her, in the early 2000s. it's so sad, but she is very positive, and still extremely active, which is a complete miracle. we hike together all the time, but i have been to enough doctor's appointments with her to know that, though she doesn't look sick at all, she is, incredibly so, and she vomits about 6 times a day on a regular day ( seen it plenty of times by now ). some of her conditions are due to the brutal abuse she suffered... which that guy, my childhood friend and martial arts partner, caused on her. incredibly horrid stories of things he said and did. once she told me the stories, some stuff he has said / done in the past sort of made sense. we had gone on a trip with the martial arts group once, and he told me a story about "" this one time when he lost it and hit her, then told her to turn him in to the cops, "" only he told maybe 0. 08 % of what happened and how bad it was. he can also be a bit demanding and conceded at times, so some of the egotistical stuff she told me would also make sense. it's still such a shock! this was one of the hardest things i had to find out in life, especially because i was also abused by someone when i was younger, and so i definitely have extreme sympathy and understanding towards victims and what we go through. it was really hard to swallow, that that guy i thought was a wonderful person, was actually an awful abuser. what's worse really is, i'll likely see him again, since i visit my school when i'm on that side of the map. it is the type of confrontation i cannot even begin to think about without getting anxious. until recently, she still had him on her facebook, as victims often keep in touch, trying not to face the situation with confrontation. i was on the fence too, about if i should block him ( once i found out ), since i didn't want him to ask, and then me tell him why, and then have him lie to my face to protect himself and make me even angrier. she posted something random once and he commented, sort of ridiculing her for what she posted, that he disagreed or whatever. unable to respond, she tagged me in a comment. i then got into a facebook argument with him, sort of hinting that i knew what he had done to her, without directly saying it. i don't think he got it, and it got so messy, that i finally blocked him and helped her do it too. now he can think that is why, but the truth is, he should know the real reason. i'm gonna end up having to say this in person, but i don't want to deal with it until i have to. : ( i also don't want people in my school to judge anything wrongly, say anything bad about her that will make me so mad. she has thanked me so much for what i did, but i didn't really do enough, and i was left with such anxiety from it all. it should feel amazing to do that for someone, especially since i have been in her shoes, but it just feels bad - it's all bad. i don't regret what i did, i just wish i had been stronger, and didn't have all this anxiety about what's to come. abusers don't say abuser on their forehead. they're often very mesmerizing people, who seem loving and amazing. that is a huge problem, because even though i completely believe her ( based on having been there, and seeing sincerity in her eyes ), even i find myself questioning at times "" but what if she created a different memory for what actually happened? "" there is no way. she gets head injections since her head swells because of how hard he beat it, years ago. she will forever suffer these cruel consequences from having dated him and for having stayed with him through hell, basically. : ( all of this makes me sick, and i hope my post is not too messy that it didn't make sense. : (","2ihr2u","","4","1","1412632962","","-0.0979714285714"

"" and took the bag. now, at my shop we always ask customers to join our mailing list and if they are already on it we log them every time they shop. she was on our mailing list so after she left i took a note of her address, this may actually be illegal in itself i don't know, but i just got a bad feeling about this woman. when she left my colleague said the boy seemed fine, but i thought if this is a regular occurrence maybe he doesn't know any different. and if she did those things in a shop in front of everyone, what does she do in the privacy of her own home? so i guess what i am asking you is should i report it? she didn't outright smack him in the middle of the shop but she got so venomous so quickly. i don't want to risk taking a mother from her son if there really is nothing too it, but at the same time i don't think what she did is an appropriate way to treat a child. i really don't know how the system works so any advice on this matter i would be truly grateful for.","23ryb0","","1","5","1398268926","[new]","-0.0201838709677"

"survivorsofabuse","throwawaye2756839","our first really full time sharing of of my own story is conducted outside of all my close friends though and through their family. ( to only mention possible smoke gas trigger withdrawal warnings )","okay, i'm not really sure how to actually type this out. i almost never open up about this, it's always uncomfortable and i feel like no one really gets what it's like to have been through abuse when i try to tell them about it. the few friends i've told have sympathy, but they'll act like they're walking on eggshells around me a good while after i tell them until we kind of just forget about the conversation. i was sitting in bed and thinking about how i've never talked to anyone who had a similar experience to mine, and i think i might find some comfort in that, or maybe some people i can relate to with the matter. i don't know. so, when i was 4 years old, my mom's boyfriend at the time molested me. she met him online, and there was a considerable age difference. after she'd been dating him for a while, she finally felt comfortable letting him watch me and my 2 brothers while she went out to do errands. one of these times it was just me and him, and i was playing my new little mermaid video game i was really excited about. i don't remember much, but i have a crystal clear memory of him getting very close to my face and saying, "" if you tell anyone, i'm gonna kill your momma. "" with a smile. and my mom told me years later when i was a teenager that when she came home that day i was crying and telling her how much i loved her. some time then passed, and i told my cousin about it when we were taking a bath together, and my aunt overheard. that's how it got around with the family. the man who did something this to me got banned from living in our county and put on the sex offenders registry, and my family later found out that he'd done the same to other kids, meeting moms online who had young children. now i'm going to talk about what gets to me the most : the aftermath. i'm 18 now. once every few years, it'll come up and i'll talk about it with my mom. she doesn't believe i've suppressed the memory because after that it happened, i started having frequent nightmares and she would hear me cry in my sleep. she feels like the shittiest mom in the world, and it hurts me so much to see her think like that. there is nothing she could've done, and i try so hard to convince her that it could have happened just as easily to someone else. and i feel like because of this happening to me, my entire family is really sensitive towards me. i can't really explain it because its been this way all my life, but i can't help but feel like things would be way different, that i would be way different if it hadn't happened. like a lot of victims of childhood sexual abuse, i got too sexually inappropriate too early, and a completely warped idea of sexuality. this went on until i was about 14. also, i can't stand people touching my without permission or getting too close or i'll feel like i can't breath. and i've never trusted men, sometimes even family members. i get anxiety if i'm in the same room alone with a guy over like 25 in the same room as me. i feel like because this happened to me that mentally i didn't develop properly sexually or something, and i identify as asexual now. i lost my virginity a few months ago, just to get it over with, and now i don't think i'd want to do it again. being exposed to sexual things that early and warping my view on the matter, sex has always been a terrifying thing to me, and i just really wish i was normal and wanted it like other people my age do. i worry about ever being in a serious relationship because i won't have sex with them or i won't enjoy it. i have nights like this where i get to thinking and wonder if it'll ever happen, because i feel like no one could ever actually love me because of this messed up part of me that i carry around. survivors of childhood sexual abuse who grew up and had healthy relationships, how did you work through it? all this being said, this is just something i think about a lot and i decided to write it down and see if anyone else is the same. i'm sorry that it's kind of a hot mess, i just wanted to get all of it out for once, i've never shared this much of it with anyone before. most of the time i feel like i am over it, but a lot of times i wonder how i would have ended up if this had never happened to me.","2rhth7","","6","1","1420530164","","0.00245476190476"

"" all the pretty clothes you have and all you manage to look like is a big blob? "" "" why do you never brush your hair? it's ratty and disgusting! "" "" it's a great thing you're not stupid. "" my mom kept my hair short, she thinned it out, she relaxed it at points. my mom began to scold everything i wore. i remember when i had problems with multiplication and my mom sat down with me one night, i just started crying because i was confused and eight and she just blew up and told me, "" you're going to figure this out or you're just going to have to stay dumb then! "" which is true, to an extent, and i did learn my times tables after that. oh, and they had a biggggg thing about my race. every time i forgot something or couldn't hear what someone was saying it was because i am half polish ( a highly generalized classification btw, as bigots are famous for, i think i have a pretty neat ancestry, but i like weird stuff ). i've heard every pollock joke, every racial slur, and i really began to hate the structure that made me look the way i look. it's kinda funny, i was 7 without a real understanding of what polish meant and what was bad about it ( i. e. nothing ) and i began to pick out polish parts of me to hate. it's kinda funny in a childlike innocence. it makes me giggle. but how do you tell a little girl that? a little girl who is traumatized? ( my dad threatened to kill my mom and us as young children, and i witnessed and experienced some pretty brutal stuff ). like i can't imagine telling anyone that, much less when i know the situation behind it. then again, i'm too scared to talk to anyone and i've always been too scared to talk to anyone. my mom told me i'd hide as a toddler and play and play for hours alone, and this trend was only amplified by the events of my childhood, especially with my parents, who were very vocal when i was bothering him. i'm always under the impression that i'm annoying people, and i know that's wrong, and i know i can't really stop thinking that without therapy. god forbid anyone raise their voice at me because i just cower and tense up and cry. i'm preoccupied with trying to make people proud of me and make myself some degree of interesting. i didn't get a smidgen of attractiveness or charisma my brother got, despite my brother having the abuse and the scrutiny tenfold, but it's just obvious everyone loves him and he's interesting like my mom and i'm just sort of the annoying little blob of gross pole in our family that resembles her father's side of the family. now that i have an idea of'polish ', i've come up with this little theory that dissects my slavic features and correlates them with my ugliness, which exists, but i can't say this ugliness exists due to slavic features but the mix of anglo american and eastern european?? this is a really weird rant, i'm sorry, i have too much time on my hands and i've got some really bad self esteem. it's hard to get into therapy when my mom actively denies these things. she says that we were great kids in retrospect, and she had no problems, and i know that just isn't the case. she might have a different perspective now, but then? it was hell. also, we're poor and i don't want to ask that right now because we can't make the mortgage as it is. i'm about to turn 17, and i would go to a school guidance counselor, but mine is ( excuse me ) the most hateful, useless counselor to ever exist. i take wellbutrin and adderall and they work to an extent ( prescribed by a gp who think i just have add, i've been described as showing strong signs of c - ptsd by a child psych we had to go to while my parents were fighting custody ), but this self hatred is just so ingrained into me. i don't think i've ever not intensely hated myself for a period longer than a month or two. i'm going to wrap this up because this subreddit probably gets a lot of these and i'm probably just whining about something stupid and making myself look like an asshole. this has just been bothering me today.","2xv8ef","","5","3","1425439527","","-0.153305"

"survivorsofabuse","AnAngryBlade","please have to get something about it straightened out ( well sorry, little wall street of text )","i hope i won't regret not posting this as a throwaway. as i posted to twoxchromosomes last night, my mom died yesterday after a very sudden illness. i was abused. my dad was extremely physically and emotionally abusive. some of my first memories are of pissing myself as he beat me. he also thought it best to destroy every smidgen of self - esteem that he saw. to him it was "" selfishness. "" my mom believed that parents should present a "" united front "" and never defended us in any way. he did not abuse her and i never saw them fight, so when he left her when i was 12 it came as a total shock. mostly i felt guilty because i was glad my dad was gone, while my mom was falling apart. from age 8 to age 11, i was sexually abused by my oldest brother. when i was 13, i was forced to tell my mother after having told a mandated reporter. she didn't believe me and accused me of "" leading him on "", but she made me agree to deny it if the abuse was reported. it wasn't reported, because the mandated reporter was told that cps would get a wall of denial from my family. by that time, my brother was dating a 12 - year - old, who he impregnated and married when she was 15 ( that was allowed at the time in the state where i grew up ). in some ways my mother was abusive, too. she had a huge closetful of clothes, but i was only allowed to have three shirts, a dress, and two pairs of pants ( and they could not be black, because i was a goth as a teenager and she didn't like that ). i was allowed one pair of nylons a month ( 1980s, american south, nylons were "" necessary "" ). one of my most vivid memories was of her attacking me and leaving handprints on my thighs that lasted for days, because i said "" shit "" after getting a runner in my nylons. i was 14. she also always humiliated me for my weight. she was a yo - yo dieter all her life ( which may have led to her death ) and even paid for me to be forcibly put on [ fen - phen ] ( http : / / en. wikipedia. org / wiki / fenfluramine / phentermine ), which could almost have killed me. i just found out last year why my pedophile brother ( who went on to sexually abuse his own daughters ) was defended by my mom even after multiple prison terms. he was sexually abused by a teenage babysitter when he was two years old, and my parents made a vow that they would deal with all the fallout from that, no matter what. that included drug abuse and pedophilia. but the last time he got out of prison, she bought him a new car and let her move in with her. as i said. she died last night. i've only talked to her three or four times in the last decade. the last time was about a month ago. i reminded her of the sexual abuse and asked how she could forgive his multiple felony prison terms ( she talked a bit about having been arrested herself for not paying a traffic ticket, as if that excused his convictions for things like manufacture of methamphetamine ). she said that he was "" all she had "", even though he literally drove me out of town at gunpoint, after which i moved 5, 000 miles away. she knew about this when it happened. i don't know how to mourn. she's my mom. i remember everything about her, how she sounded, the smell of her perfume, how she moved. now she's in a refrigerated drawer in a morgue. and she's still my mom. i can't believe that we can't reconcile. i can't believe that i cannot ever call her. i just can't believe it ended this way. i'm not sure what my point is in posting this. i just needed to get it out and i have no other way of doing so, i guess. if you bothered to read it all, i thank you.","2pdh4b","","5","5","1418663413","","-0.222961702128"

( trigger warnings, sexual abuse )","i decided to post, after finding this subreddit. i intend to use fake names for each person involved in this story, but it's going to span several years. hopefully it won't be too long. * edit * wow, that turned out way longer than i expected. sorry about that. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - when i was 8, my father remarried. my stepmother seemed okay, at first. her oldest daughter got married to lewis. lewis was an ass. he enjoyed punishing us girls ( one younger stepsister, and two older than me, plus his wife - 5 of us in all ) for every little thing we did. dropped something? in the corner! broke something? spanking time! he used a paint stirring stick to spank us. i'd had them used on me by my dad for my entire childhood, but lewis took it to a new level. instead of one sized for 1 gallon paint containers, it was one designed for a 5 gallon container. he cut grooves and holes into it as well, to make sure that it hurt every single stroke. i hated him with a passion. the summer i turned 9, i went to spend the summer with my mother. this had been an ongoing thing since my parents divorced when i was 2. my stepfather had a habit of locking me outside the house during the day, so that he could watch porn in over the living room. i didn't mind too much, most of the time, because i enjoyed playing outside. though being locked out in the middle of the tuscon summer was considerably less fun. my mother and i went bowling for my birthday. she needed more money for a few more games, since she had only brought in enough for a couple of games. she sent me to the car to get it. on the way out, i passed some creepy looking guys. there were 4 of them. i made it to the car, and unlocked the door, climbing inside to be able to reach the money. ( i'm still extremely short, it was worse as a child. ) i felt a hand wrap around my ankle, and haul me out of the car. i was gang raped around the side of that building. they passed me around like some kind of toy, one after another. when they finished with me, they just left. left me standing there, bruised, scratched, and bleeding. my mother never came out to see what was wrong. i got my jacket from the car, and wrapped it around myself, and went inside. when i told her what happened, she simply looked at me and rolled her eyes, and told me to stop lying. there was blood running down both of my legs, and she told me i was faking it. summer ended, and it was time to go back to my father's for the school year. i had spoken to my dad previously, and told him that if lewis wasn't nicer, i wouldn't be coming back. i'd either stay with my mother, or move back in with my grandmother. he called me back a couple of days later, and said he'd spoken to lewis, and that he'd be nicer. i had only been back a few days, the first time he came to my room. he sat down on the edge of my bed, because he'd heard me crying from outside the door. i was reliving my rape from that summer. he was an adult in my life, and i ( at the time ) thought that i could trust the adults in my life. so i explained to him what happened ; told him how i felt during and after, how horrible it was when my mother didn't believe me, how i was freaked out at the idea of going anywhere alone. he pulled me onto his lap, wrapped his arms around me, and rocked me until i stopped crying and fell asleep. the next night, he was back in my room. he once again sat down on the edge of the bed, but this time, he took my hand and slid it through the gap in his boxers, "" showing me "" the button on them. eventually this led further, into getting my entire hand in his boxers completely, and his hand under my nightgown. this happened every night for weeks. my father was always at work at bedtime, and no one else seemed to notice or care what was happening. finally, lewis and my sister moved into their own place, and i finally had a break. i only had to deal with him on weekends, and school vacations. it sucked, but it was tolerable. he kept telling me how he wanted me to "" be his little whore "" for the entire time he stayed married to my sister. i was glad he lived elsewhere. they started managing a small motel, in the tiny little town we lived in. lewis and my sister lived in the managers apartment. there was no other staff. they did the laundry, cleaning, everything. that year, our house caught on fire from faulty wiring. most of the roof was burned off, and us youngest girls ( just 3 of us ) were sent to stay with lewis and my sister. that's when things got really bad for me. i was 11 at the time, and it was decided that i would be their new maid. every day, i cleaned all 12 rooms in the motel. lewis "" supervised "" me. that was when he started actually raping me. before that, it had been some seriously heavy petting, but no actual intercourse. in those rooms, it changed to intercourse. when he couldn't perform, he started using objects on me - whatever happened to be handy. i could start a list, but really, use your imagination of a motel room and a maid's cart. that's probably all that needs to be said. we lived with them for almost 2 years. when i was 13, we moved from that small town to another one in a different state. while living there, my two stepsisters closest in age to me filed sexual abuse charges against my father. the police came to our apartment, dragged me out of the bathtub ( literally ) and took me to the station to take my statement. since my father had never done anything even remotely like that to me, i told them that, and that they were accusing the wrong guy. when i finally got to go back home, i told my stepmom about what lewis had been doing to me for years. she looked at me, tipped her head to the side, and said, "" well, you wanted him to be nicer to you. how much nicer do you want him to be? you're getting exactly what you asked for, you little bitch, so deal with it. "" i never brought it up to her again. after that, i moved in with my mother during the school year, and started spending summers with my father. unfortunately, since my stepmother didn't care that lewis was raping me, i still had to associate with him. even worse, either my father didn't care, or he didn't know. my stepmother told me not to bother him with it "" again "", so i assumed he knew. at 14, lewis asked his wife, my step sister, if she'd be willing to bring me to bed with them. she agreed. i refused several times, but it didn't help. she tied me up, he raped me while she watched. i've still never forgiven her. she did finally leave him, after realizing that her two daughters were rapidly approaching the age that i had been when he started molesting me, and she didn't want the same thing to happen to them. while living with my mother, i discovered a wild streak. i started partying, drinking, smoking weed, smoking cigarettes, sneaking out, and having sex with just about anyone that would have me. i felt like that was all i was good for, so i may as well be good at it. so i practiced. a lot. i was enjoying myself, but at the same time i felt dirty, guilty. like i didn't deserve anything better. my mother moved back to my hometown with me, when i was 15. i started babysitting for her sister and her husband, especially during the summer and school breaks. they had two daughters at the time. i enjoyed playing with my cousins, and my aunt and uncle were both pot smokers too, and very laid back, so that was an added benefit. they paid me not in cash, but in cartons of cigarettes. it worked out well. until i started spending the night. her husband, allen, would creep into the living room at night, and start running his hand up and down my leg, until it partially woke me up. he'd nudge my legs apart, get his hand under my panties, and enjoy himself. after the first few months, he started performing oral sex on me each time. the visits could last anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple of hours. allen didn't stop until he was arrested and jailed for indecent exposure to two minors. he's now a registered sex offender. i knew he didn't do it. i could have alibied him for the time in question. i let him go down for it anyway. it was more of a choice on which punishment he wanted. i knew he didn't do it, because he had been performing oral sex on me for the two hour block of time it was supposed to have been happening three miles away. my life continued spiraling out of control at that point. i still had good grades in school, but i was either drunk or high all the time. i was routinely having sex of some sort several times a day, nearly every day of the week, and usually with different partners. i had a few that i saw often, but no boyfriend, and i wasn't interested in having one. i participated in threesomes and orgies, with guys ranging from my age ( 16ish at the time ) to their mid - 30's. sometimes there were other girls, sometimes there weren't. i didn't care. i once again felt dirty, and unlovable. that this was all that was left for me, but it didn't matter, since i was absolutely sure i'd never live past my 18th birthday. if i did, i certainly wouldn't make it past 21. it just couldn't happen. four days after my nineteenth birthday, i was married. i had met him when i was 16, introduced by a friend and lover. i thought he was great. he treated me well, seemed like he really cared about me. we had been married a little over 3 months when i got pregnant. we didn't know it at the time. once we got married, our sex life started degrading. he hated oral sex ( giving and receiving ) and i loved it. so he started sending me to a mutual friends house, with the request of the friend to "" satisfy that shit, so i ( he ) won't have to "" ; we were both strangely okay with this. i had our son at noon. by 3pm, my husband raped me for the first time. in my hospital bed. he spent the next two weeks raping me at least twice a day. at the end of that two weeks, i was pregnant again. the rapes stopped during the pregnancy, but i was yelled at a lot more often, and slapped around a bit. after i had our second son, i started on the shot, to ensure it wouldn't happen again. he started raping me routinely again, only this time it was anal. if i wasn't bleeding and crying on the ground afterwards, it wasn't good enough. if i didn't scream during it, he'd make sure to find a way to make me scream. often, i couldn't walk afterwards. when i "" misbehaved "", i would end up tied and in the closet, sometimes for hours at a time. he also started passing me around to his friends. inviting them over, and tying me up, then letting them use me one after the other, until they were satisfied. this became an every - weekend thing. i loathed him, i loathed his friends, and most of all, i loathed myself. i stayed with him for six years. i would try to escape, and he would take it out on our sons. none of the women's shelters had room for me and my two sons, and none of my family could ( or would ) take all three of us in. he'd abuse them, and i'd come scampering back to get between them again. at 24, i grew some balls, and rented myself an apartment. i started slowly moving things into it, a little bit at a time, so he wouldn't notice a lot of things gone. it took almost 2 months to finish. when i went to get the last load of things, he was waiting for me. he beat the shit out of me. i ended up with 2 black eyes, a broken nose, 4 cracked ribs, and a broken finger. i had perfect imprints of the tread of his boots on my back, and imprints of the toes of his boots on my chest, where he'd kicked me hard enough to lift me off the ground. i didn't see him again until he started showing up at my workplace. i had a security escort everywhere i went after that. at 30, i had had two more children, another son and a daughter, with a different father. well, they shared one, but it was not my husband. i had fallen into a depression spiral, and the state stepped in and took them. my older two were living with their grandmother. i sent them to live with her when myself and my boyfriend both lost our jobs. i wanted to make sure they were taken care of. i ended up having to move in with my father and stepmother. she still hated me. she made several trips to the hospital, and finally went to stay with one of my older stepsisters. it was just me and my father in the house. my computer was set up in the living room, because it was the only place i could connect to the internet. his laptop was on the table, about 3 feet in front of me. when he'd come in from work, he'd lock the door, and immediately strip naked, sit down, turn on some porn, and start rubbing one out. i always hid behind my monitor, because that's something i never want to see. when he finished, he'd put some shorts on, and go to bed. he told me, during one of our long afternoons together with no cable tv, that my two younger stepsisters had been right : he had started having intercourse with them about the time that i turned 9, making one 7 and the other 11. i was shocked, to say the least. he said that he and lewis had shared them, but that he didn't know that lewis was also molesting me. he was rather angry about that. it blew my mind. he also told me that over the last several months, when my niece and her girlfriend were staying there ( lewis's youngest daughter ) that he had walked in on them having oral sex, and insisted that he get it too. after that, it became a regular thing until they broke up and moved out. i left a couple of months later - a friend offered me a place to stay that was well away from there, and i jumped at it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - here's the part that i'm not sure how to explain to a therapist. obviously, i can get through my history rather well. i have a wonderful sense of detachment most of the time when telling it. i have flashbacks and nightmares, but not usually when speaking of it. they just show up randomly. my problem is some of the psychological ramifications. my particular kinks in sex is one of them - i don't even care about actual sex. i want oral sex performed on me, and i want objects used on me. that's actually pretty much it. i don't want to please anyone else, i just want it to be me - centric. i feel slightly guilty about that, but only slightly. a small part of me feels that after everything i've survived, it's my turn to be the one in charge. i've also got a strange fascination with..... violence. i don't know another way to put it. i enjoy watching not only horror flicks and torture porn, but looking at forensic photos, crime scene photos, suicide aftermaths, etc. i daydream about violence, murder, suicide ( not my own ), and other things of that nature. i read about serial killers, mass killers, spree killers, serial rapists, serial torturers. and every bit of it turns me on. on reflection, i realized that a great deal of what i enjoyed before my marriage is stuff that i still enjoy today. i feel weird about that. i know i was molested, and intellectually, i know i'm not responsible for it. but then i look at my teen years, with me sleeping around, and i know that that was my choice. that i didn't have to do that, and i feel a great sense of shame, and that what's happening to me now is no more than i deserve. i felt that way while married, as well. that the beatings and the rapes he delivered to me were no more and no less than i deserve for enjoying being molested when i was younger. i don't think i'm actually a danger to society, even with the thoughts of violence. i've spent a few days in jail ( failure to appear for child support! ) and i came out more paranoid and filled with social anxiety than i went in. i already know i don't want to go back, and will do whatever is required to not go back. so actually acting out on any of my impulses or thoughts is just no. i want to be completely honest with my therapist. i have my first appointment next week. but i also don't want to be locked up or committed, or stuck on some kind of watch or list because i actually tell the full truth. what do you guys suggest? it sounds like a lot of you have at least been in the ballpark of where i am, in regards to therapy and the fear of being viewed askance. maybe not for the same reason, but the feelings are similar, i would think. i welcome comments or pms. your choice.","2mjlcm","","4","10","1416212877","Possible Trigger Warning","-0.0533942622951"

"survivorsofabuse","JLunaM","while returning to this text uni, questions, new sources blame","ive been back in uni for about a month. it had happened when i was in the second year. i didnt finish my second year as i was really unwell. i took a year out and now i've returned to do my second year again whilst the people i used to know are in their fourth. the ones that have spotted me around uni have been smiley and friendly and have asked me things like,'did you go travelling? ','you're in third year now right? '. to the former, i put on a smile and say i did and to the latter i say how silly i was to leave before finishing the year so i have to re do it and they accept it as truth. as part of my agreement with my uni ive had to see various departments and have to continue seeing these groups throughout the year as well as occupational health screening regularly - - so it's been a really busy few weeks. at one meeting they forwarded the details of the psychological services, so i went ahead and fully answered the in depth questions they require when signing up. i went to the meeting assigned to me. the psychologist asked me more in depth questions, told me that no help would be offered to me, asked me some more questions, then asked me three specific questions that have been playing over and over in my head : have you managed to have sex? did you enjoy the sex? ( he then asked about my previous relationships to which, i replied, that my current partner was my only real relationship which led to ) - did you lose your virginity to your boyfriend? i was in shock, i muddled my words but was finally able to answer with my voice shaking. he then told me that my problems were to complex for them to deal with. i accepted his words, thanked him for seeing me, then walked off, trying my best not to burst into tears. what he asked and the way he asked them still make me feel really uncomfortable. ive relapsed into panic episodes and sleeplessness. sometimes, i will only see this man besides my abuser, other times, beside my old friends with the things they have said to me playing on repeat. today i saw an old friend ( at her request ), she jokingly called me slutty. and also had a go at me for being'rude ', and'awkward'to an old class his mate i had come across that assumed i went travelling in my gap year. also, proclaimed i had some sort of prejudice against my old classmates whilst we were on the train ( a lot of them have similar cultural and religious background ). tonight the speeches on repeat have been hers and the psychologists. its half 3am and i need to wake up early. im slutty. rude. racist. slutty. if i was really raped i shouldn't have sex. i shouldn't enjoy sex. i can't orgasm now because i feel disgusted with myself. there is no use in me complaining. i should have said to him that his questions made me feel uncomfortable ( violated ). i should have told her that seeing all of them makes me feel inadequate, i feel like a failure, they ask a lot of intrusive questions ( unknowingly ) that flare up my anxiety and put me in a negative mental state for several days afterwards.","2k25vv","","7","6","1414031994","","-0.129643243243"

( lots and of triggers ).","long story short, i was a normal child until we met my step - father. things seemed a little strange as we ’ d stay at stranger ’ s homes and never hung around long until my single - mother met my womanizing, self - destructive step - father from hell. i never understood it. any of it. ( than as i sit here sucking on a rum bottle, i realize why i walked in on my mother sleeping with all the men that we stayed with, just to have somewhere to stay... we never had enough money for a home. fun... ). as time ran on, evictions and complaints ran rampant, we moved from montana to massachusetts, situating ourselves in an upstairs apartment. my brother was to live in the downstairs part of this duplex, while i lived alone with my parents upstairs. things seemed normal, i was in school, doing well. i spent a lot of time with family, loved my outings with my cousin. my aunt and i were super close and i remember vividly, staring in awe at her crystal collection. i was genuinely happy, but course demons try to crawl their way out of hell and oftentimes succeed. the demon infected a mere ten year old child with sexual assault, sticking it ’ s grimy fingers into innocence, destroying any power and confidence that child had. unfortunately, that is me. he followed my family, causing disruption, repeatedly catching me off guard. the second time my body was desecrated ; i called my grandmother heaving and left home to stay with her downstairs. my cries for help were blatantly ignored, as my mother was too interested in her boyfriend to listen when her child shakily begged “ he touched me, please help ”, and my grandmother too ignorant to care. “ she turned off him on ”. they say, “ she is lying, she just doesn ’ t like him! ” i spent my childhood getting felt up by my satanic step - father. i learned to avoid him at all costs and disappear when he came into the room, which made my ‘ parents ’ try to “ make us a family ” again. every part of me was taken advantage of by him. but it got so much worse as time went on. eventually i was so disturbed that the teachers and my parents put me into school counseling services. i told them what had happened, but i had a hunch. they didn ’ t believe me. no one did. so i told them my stepfather threatened to kill me. anything to get him away from me. after all, i was 12. legal problems, threats of “ homelessness ” and “ isolation ” were thrown my way, as well as my kitten used as a weapon. “ you ’ ll never see her again if you don ’ t drop this! ” i was told. “ you will never see us again if you keep lying! ”. i wanted nothing more than a family, so i caved and told the social workers that i lied. the second biggest mistake of my life. having had a nightmarish time with my family, i was sent to another state to live with my biological father. things were better, although my developing post - traumatic stress reared its ugly head. my father and stepmother got sick of dealing with my depressive symptoms, and sent me to my second grandmother ’ s home, where i was told how useless i was for a year. how everyone hated me and that ’ s why i lived there. maine state almost took me, as i was considered by an entire town at this point, as a lying child with no future. a screwed up little human. i was instead sent back to my mothers. again, used as a sex - toy for my pedophile step father. this horrific time continued as my step - father was using cocaine, alcohol, and found cheating on my mother with my aunt, and a whole bunch of human trash. they threw things at eachother all the time, used me as a weapon against suicide and mentally scarred me for life. my mother kicked my stepfather out, and for a short time i was free. than he pulled a gun on himself and she rescued him. he said he ’ d get better, but the abuse continued. he was sent to an asylum about three times, got aggressive with my mother, threatened to hurt us. looked me straight in the face when i was 14, and told me i was a bitch. that was after i told him to get away from my mom when he had a keyboard in his hands ready to beat her with it. when things calmed a bit, my step - father thought of us as a ‘ couple ’. he ’ d constantly grab my ass, try to get me drunk. he always had arguments that my mom was jealous of our relationship. he took me on car rides and masturbated as i was learning to drive. he went to grab me and for once in my life i slapped him away. i fell into a depression, and the night i caught him taking photos of me in the shower, i cut my wrists open. i was done. unfortunately, i failed. all this abuse hindered my ability to continue homeschooling. yes, i was homeschooled after i dropped out of school in 4th grade. my mom stopped teaching me. but this was the least of my worries, as i was trying to figure out how to escape. forever trapped and isolated in this abuse. the second time i tried to kill myself was with pesticides. i sprayed a ton of wasp killer into a colored plastic cup and attempted to drink it. instead, i inhaled the fumes. the third and fourth times were with prescribed muscle - relaxers. i overdosed twice on them. i never wanted to wake up. eventually i got out of the house. after being toyed with for too long, i got out. i met my husband. i got out. but the demon still lingers. in the last three years i ’ ve had numerous suicide attempts. i ’ ve cut my wrists, overdosed on ativan, drank alcohol with opiate painkillers, got hooked on opiate painkillers, used benzos to drown my emotions away. none of this worked. i ’ m still here. i ’ ve gone to psychiatrists who prescribe placebo pills, ssris that make me much more anxious. i don ’ t go outside anymore. i don ’ t talk to people. i don ’ t want a family. i ’ ve had more than 7 jobs in the last three years. i never graduated 8th grade, yet everyone assumes this was because of being lazy. well. it wasn ’ t. it was, feast or famine. survive or die. now i sit here in the cold, angry, hateful. i have no easy way to the future. i sit here daily thinking about how much i hate normal people, how lucky my in - laws are for being able to go to school, get college. the reason i wrote this today was because i ’ m sick of being judged, when they do not know the true factors that contributed to my suffering, and my status as a 20 year old dropout with no job. i'm tired of hearing about it... … i ’ m done writing now..","2r5kh4","","5","2","1420244665","","-0.207546"

"domesticviolence","bookworm1980","the cycle of spiritual violence","part 4 my last post was difficult, murky, and other then what i remember, has never been substantiated. it is just what i remember and was probably not very well written. i'm sorry... i had to be pretty buzzed to even get that out cause it was my first time saying it ever to anyone. this post is about after my parents separated and were divorcing so my lame, drunk, wife beating, drug abusing dad could be with his new girlfriend. dad didn't like mom to work. maybe if it had been the 50's he'd have been okay, but whenever she worked he thought she was flirting with co workers. he forced her out of college 4 credits shy of graduating with a marketing degree. he left her 5 months after my little brother was born. he refused to pay child support. if he came to pick me and my infant brother up drunk and mom called the cops the said he had a court order to take us. the cops would force my mom to let us go with dad, seeing he was drunk and at times that he'd hit her around, and instead of pulling him over for a dui, they just left. every fucking time! i came to hate all cops. they never helped us, meaning me and my brother. i acted out in school. grade school sucked. dad took the good car and left us with a pile of shit and no money. i walked a mile and a half to and from school from 1st grade on cause i had to. i don't really know how to explain all this. we lived in a basically all retired neighborhood ( it was a dumb buy on good property ), but right across the highway there were projects. not like bad ones, just section 8, before that became bad, hell my family was one step away from it. this little black boy, he was heavy, but so was i, for years walked me to and from school from there. he changed his name a few times. it was leland or charles and i remember his last name but won't say it here. he was a god send, all thru high school. he got beat up a few times so i could run from older mean boys who wanted to hurt a little girl by herself. i'll never forget him, but it wasn't fucking ever sexual for me... he just protected me. really, unless i go year by year, this all seems jumbled. i'm trying to shorten it so it makes sense, but when i do i feel like i'm leaving out very vidid stories. like in kindergarten and 1st grade i had to go thru the embarrassment of'speech'class. which was 3 or 4 of us kids being put in a coat closet practicing words. and i still say buttons as buddons as an example. my bf finds it cute. hell, so do i. like i know how to say wash, but unless i'm in the presence of the president i'll probably still say warsh. lol. the point is, like 5 of us were singled out in kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade and taken into a closet, which already i had bad memories of, to do tests. i was singled out in my class. i'd be late cause i had to walk, or the car didn't start or had no gas. in conjunction with my last post, my parents divorcing, school, my dad's new gfs mean kids.... i started losing time. i started sleeping alot. i had nightmares about spinning and spinning and spinning until i just would fall and i always thought i would fall to hell unless i woke up. i had nightmares about being chased by something until i got to my once a week music lesson place. i read. by 3rd grade i read a nancy drew novel a day, then a hardy boy novel, then their combined novels. i told my 3rd grd teacher to fuck off when i got pissed about not understanding multiplication.... and then spent the rest of the year right next to her desk. everyone thought i was a freak. i had constant nosebleeds. gushers that lasted 2 or 3 hours. i missed so much school. i had parents that were divorced. i cussed and talked back. i only read, but was easily made fun of if they did include me and then i cried, which was funny. and again, once my little brother was there, people hurt him cause i was weird. i had no friends. they only talked to me to get me in trouble. april of 5th grade ( another story ) my dad died. suddenly these kids, the people who had tortured me, wanted to include me in everything. my fat 5th grade ass was given a cheerleader costume. kids who had treated me like shit came up and said sorry and said their mom or dad had died of this or that. and not to be hateful, but they were popular and after everything, i didn't care about their pain anymore. they had made my life hell for so long. like suddenly cause my douche bag, alcoholic, drug addicted, wife beating dad dying made us closer!?!?!?!? i was happy to be free. but everyone else acted like i should be upset. i still can't say i've dealt with that. my dad dying was probably the best thing that ever has happened for me. mom wanted to send me to a psychologist, but i was already knowledgeable about money. i knew we couldn't afford it. she probably should have anyway.... considering i would go into hysterical fits about not being crazy. but we really couldn't afford it. i was also going thru puberty, so.... outbursts weren't uncommon. i feel like i'm skipping so much. my bf is gonna be on a weekend so i doubt i'll write again for a few days. but there's so much of grade school i just skimmed over. sorry....","2gd0lf","","2","0","1410693191","[new]","-0.0982034090909"
"survivorsofabuse","ne-wo","thus dealing closely with questions","from when i was a child until my dad died a year ago, he would beat me. it's something that has caused me a lot of issues in my life so far, but i am in therapy and have been dealing with it. in the last few months, i have gotten up fairly close with a girl named lucy. now lucy was abused as a child so it just was something that brought us together. i have shared a lot of details about my abuse with with her that i haven't shared even with my closest friends ( i always worry that talking to them about it will make them uncomfortable ), and she shared a lot with me as well. eventually lucy really began to develop romantic feelings towards me, and ended up asking me to date just her. i rejected dating her as gently as i could as i have feelings for someone else. she seemed to really understand, all was probably good. fast forward to about a week ago. turns out, lucy wasn't being as understanding as i thought. sometimes she ended up telling people very detailed accounts of the my abuse. ever since then, i've had a lot of people i only know casually approaching me to ask questions. having people i barely know wanting to know about something that personal makes me incredibly uncomfortable. i don't really know how to handle this. i especially don't want to outright come off as an asshole by telling these people to fuck off, because some of them are people i need money to keep a friendly relationship with just for business reasons. how would you really handle this?... i feel exactly like dealing with this is setting me back with progress i've made in healing.","2jgu61","","4","7","1413502571","","-0.0163882352941"
"survivorsofabuse","Mkall","now my new friend in flordia needs help","i don't know how good friends we are, we only talk through msn, and have never talked by phone or voice chat. i don't even know if i'd ever like him if i ever met him in person, but nonetheless i seem to be the one he talks with about all that's happening in his life. i've done my best to guide him to making better choices and improving his future but he just slides back to his old self whenever he even starts to improve his life. i'm hoping that someone can help him, or point me in a direction of resources, since i'm literally on the opposite end of the continent than he is. i'm going to call him daryl ( certainly not his real name ) daryl's story : he was raised in a verbally abusive household, and i suspect there was at least some physical abuse though he'd never confirm it. his older brother was given preferential treatment in every way and even though he now lives the drug - addicted lifestyle, his mom still thinks the world of him over daryl. i suspect that daryl may have been an accidental child, but have never broached the subject as it really has no bearing ( imo ) parents divorced before i met him four years back. daryl lived with his dad who didn't treat him all that well, but more or less pretended he didn't exist for any other reason than to yell at. eventually dad moved away and left him behind. it's possible the dad died later, but that's never been confirmed by daryl ( to my knowledge ). anyways he meets a friend through a common - interest website and that friend offers to let daryl live in his house for a while. sounds like a good thing right? well it's not. daryl's friend and wife are the type of people you'd probably see on that hoarders show. their house is a mess, their yard is a mess, and their attitudes stink worse than the place. daryl's "" friend "" is a control freak and his wife isn't much better. i hope that this is encouragement for daryl to get out and find his own way. sadly i'm mistaken. after much more verbal abuse ( and stolen / misused items ), daryl is kicked out again and is forced to live with the one person in the world he doesn't want to : his mother. but there is an interesting upside! he gets employed at the local walmart. the job lasts for about 8 months ( estimated ) before comments made by daryl ( alledgedly out of work time ) are twisted, amplified, and used against him to fire him from said job. that was about a year ago. since getting the job up until today, daryl has been living with his mother. she is the precise person that / r / athiesm describes every day ; ignorant, arrogant, selfish. she was the primary source of daryl's abuse during his childhood and now here he is living with her again. she constantly abused him emotionally during his 2 - year stay with her and forced him to do most of the chores and house work. things came to a head today when she decided to kick him out of the house. i suggested he find an outreach program that could point him in the right direction. i did a quick google search and found this : http : / / www. outreachcentercf. org /. i have no idea if it is precisely what he needs, but it seemed like a good start. his response "" i'd rather die than accept help from groups like that. "" my reply "" say that again when you're living on the streets "" i've always taken a hard line when trying to get him to improve his life, it seems that if i was too gentle, he'd immediately dismiss it. so this is my last attempt to help him. i've tried for four years to assist him in any way i can ( which i will admit is limited since i don't sen him money, he'd only spend it on frivolous things ) and he just continues to slip away. if anyone has options in the central florida area ( i believe he lives near lake city ) for either adult education, counselling, or work placement, please let me know. what to know about daryl : * he's 25 years old * hard working. he's very motivated to get the job done, but needs direction to start. * not in very good physical shape. i suggested enlistment more than once because it gives shelter, skills, food and companions ; but he's convinced he's in no shape to join the army. * i can't remember the term, but he has the condition where he's afraid of dealing with, or being part of, large crowds of people * he lives a sheltered life. he plays computer games and has a collection of action figures. he once got it into him to sell off those figures and use the funds to move out. he ended up selling three and used the funds to buy a computer game * he has a self - defeating attitude. every opportunity i offer him, he shoots down nearly immediately. schools are too crowded, mcdonalds would have him at the till working with customers. * he has an odd sense of entitlement. i counselled him to save his money to move out of the house. instead he would rather spend it on more things like his action figures or his computer. he would not move out until he got a good computer system. yes, i realise this is an escapist attitude. * socially awkward. he means well, but he hasn't learned when to keep his mouth closed. this gets him into trouble. anyone have any thoughts or advise? thanks!","mgk30","","5","4","1321590467","","0.0576042857143"

"domesticviolence","Throwawawyayayay","recently on i had realized that i missed a girl that broke up with me was about just 6 months old ago ; and i called her to try and reconcile things quickly and found out who she's been abused for around the past 6 single months","this ended up being way longer than i thought, so sorry for the eye strain, but here's my ongoing story ( and by the way, i have to leave right now and won't be back for at least a couple hours, so please don't be offended or worried if i don't reply ) : we were together for a couple years up until things kind of fizzled towards the end of last year. i've been thinking a lot about her lately because honestly i'm an asshole and just really took her for granted when we were together. a couple weeks after we broke up i got a weird text that asked me not to answer the phone or respond to any texts from her number, but since i didn't think we would be speaking any time soon i found it odd and thought she might be in trouble. so i drove to her house and met the piece of shit that day, not realizing that she had been dating anyone. he told me he had been paranoid she was cheating on him and she had sent me that text because she thought he might go through her phone. we ended up having a very weird conversation, him and i, where he told me that they had been dating for a few weeks and that my ex had been getting violent with him. in the two years we were together, she never once exhibited violent tendencies. quite the opposite, she's very passive and i had to coax her into telling me if she was mad / sad about anything. it didn't click until recently that abusers blame their victims. i was mad at her for moving on so quickly, so i was stupidly willing to believe the lies he fed me that day. so i invite her to dinner to try and reconcile things, not knowing whether they were still together ( paul and i still hadn't realized at this point the abuser - blame thing ) and i tell her how i feel. she tells me that for the past 6 months, she's lived in terror. he chokes her, squeezes her, and threatens to kill her on a regular basis. he unplugs her computer while she's trying to do homework. he stands over her and stares at her while she's trying to be alone. he accuses her of being in the cia and of conspiring against him. weird shit. at one point it got so bad that a neighbor called the police. they arrested him and put a restraining order on him, but she made excuses for him and actually went to the da and advocated for him. after he got out of jail he went right back to her house, but because of what happened the landlords asked her to move out ( and evicted him ). she didn't have to, but she complied because he made her feel guilty that he had no place to go. so when she gets a new place he goes with her. she has a history of drug use but had been clean for more than a year. because of this she starts using again, and that piece of shit snapped a photo of her snorting a line. he told her that if she calls the cops he'll send the picture to her work, her school, and her probation officer. she's spent the last few years working her ass off trying to get into law school, working past having a felony possession charge. if he did this she'd never be able to finish her degree, so she doesn't know what to do. so at dinner i convinced her that she needed to get the fuck out of there. it was difficult, partly because of the blackmail but partly because she actually still cares about this piece of shit and doesn't want him to go to jail or end up on the street. she agrees to stay with me and tell him he had to leave, and if not she ’ d call the cops, but first she needed to go home and get some things and she wanted to give him the chance to leave voluntarily. she said i couldn ’ t go with her because if he saw me he ’ d fuck us both up ( and he could ) but that she ’ d be safe. we made a plan that she had to keep in touch every 20 minutes and i would be close so i could call the cops and drive over there at a moment ’ s notice. well she did keep in touch, but in the last 20 minutes he assaulted her again. she managed to run out but he took her house key. that was wednesday. she been staying with me since then, and every day she has a new excuse as to why that day isn ’ t the day to call the cops. the original plan was “ 2 days to leave otherwise the police are involved. ” then she got it in her head to talk to a friend ’ s ex bf who is an ex abuser that has changed his life. i figured he would just tell her what i was telling her, but instead this idiot thinks that getting the police involved will only make things worse. he says he ’ s probably just on drugs and will realize what he ’ s done after he sobers up ; this makes her feel even more guilty because she understands what it ’ s like to be under the influence of drugs. this friend ’ s ex tells her that he ’ ll handle it himself. so right now, she, him and her friend are on the apartment property. he is going to go upstairs to try to convince him to leave, and if not then they ’ ll call the cops. but what then? what the fuck if he comes back? i feel like the only rational person in this situation and i have no idea what to do. i could call the cops right now but it might fuck up her life if he releases the photo, and she already told me that she wouldn ’ t tell them about the abuse unless she thought it was going to happen again ( yeah right ). all he ’ d get would be a violation of the restraining order, which means what, a month, maybe two at the most in jail? i know she ’ s safe right now, because dude is a big guy and piece of shit doesn ’ t have any weapons, but what about tomorrow? what about when i ’ m not around to protect her?","272rjc","","3","5","1401674407","[new]","-0.210670175439"

"survivorsofabuse","lunatic_minge","when do i get to really be sexually angry?","quickest backstory i can muster, promise. my father was condescending and sexist in the extreme. my stepfather was not much better, in addition to being verbally and mentally abusive. my childhood was controlled by his moods and my parent's loud, often violent fighting. i learned to stay quiet, stay out of the way, and certainly never share any emotions about the fighting that was going on. mom parentified me, would push me to recite that it was okay, that i loved my stepfather, that i loved her, that everything was okay. i learned to put my emotions after everyone else's. as an adult, i continued to play into the pattern as i watched my mother steadily crumble. i brought the pattern into my marriage, gutting our trust and playing the part of the abuser, to avoid becoming my mother. our marriage ended two years ago. very quickly i ended up in a new relationship. intent on not repeating the mistakes from my marriage, the pendulum swung the other way. he is an angry, egotistical, immature person who manipulated me on a daily basis, had no respect for my personal boundaries, who rewarded any attempt to speak up for myself with hours of anger as punishment. i became emotionally mute, justifying his behaviors to everyone in my life, propping him up, taking less than my share of everything - the house, money, food, entertainment, it was all for him. i broke up with him over a month ago. it took him time to find a place, and he's moving out today. i've been debating with myself for days whether or not i should be here when he moves his things out ( i am not concerned about him stealing or being vindictive about anything ). i would stay because i hate the idea of him moving out of an empty house. he doesn't understand why we broke up, not really, and he's so deep into his own bullshit he isn't likely to really come to terms with it. he's heartbroken and i can read it all over him. or is that just more manipulation? i keep thinking of my fathers. how many years i fantasized about tying them up and taping their mouths shut so that i could finally tell them what they'd done to me, the damage they wrought, how degrading it was to have to worship and obey them both when neither are anywhere near as intelligent ones as me . here i am putting another abuser in my past without ever finding my voice. yet again i am robbed of the chance to tell them exactly how i feel. all the same, my emotional instincts don't allow me to be angry enough to confront my ex. i can't imagine writing him a letter i'd ever send, can't imagine hurting him. i keep hearing my mother's voice. "" someone hurt that little boy. he doesn't know what he's doing. "" something inside me screams how could he not?!?! how does anything he experienced keep him from seeing the anguish, the humiliation he inflicted? why does his ignorance make it okay? i don't even know where to begin to take ownership over the reactions i know i have a right to. if i don't learn to react properly to being uncomfortable, hurt, angry when i'm disrespected, how am i ever going to break this cycle? where do i begin?","34abtl","","3","1","1430322161","","-0.22387027027"

"domesticviolence","NoOneCanKnowMyName","bad late mother style issues.","i am about to reveal a lot of personal information about myself and my mother's history, so if anyone i know just happens to read this... you'll probably figure out who i am. i'm not sure where to begin ; i suppose it will be with a basic history of my mother : she is 65, nearing retirement in her field, and batshit insane. the roots of evil were seeded when she was born into poverty as the fifth unwanted child. her uncle ( and possibly father ) molested her, her own mother once kicked her off the porch on a tricycle when she was a toddler, and overall was raised in a very violent household. her mother died of a heart attack at 45, and the two had never reconciled. she has hinted at, and i truly believe, that she hates all men. as a child, my sister and i were constant witnesses to the abuse of our father, and i distinctly remember how at an early age, she and i begged her to stop screaming at dad in the car. this tactic worked for a while, but she soon ignored our pleas and resumed the abuse. fast forward to 2001 : eight grade. my mother up an decided to move us to northern georgia on a whim, leaving my father to tend to his company in florida. it did not take long for her to choose me as the successor of abuse. i would be verbally assaulted, and on some occasions, tackled and beaten. adjusting to school was difficult. i always had been part of a relatively popular crowd in florida, and never had to stand up for myself ; my friends would do it for me. not so here. i was seen as an outsider, on the very first day of school made enemies. within a week i was having fist fights ; not allowing anyone to walk on me. i never made fun of anyone, nor taunted others. i always treated others the way i felt i should should be, and if they didn't treat me right, they'd hurt. by freshman year, the school had me barred from my most electives, and most people knew not to fuck with me by this point. it was lonely. i was always lonely. my first real girlfriend had her parents die in a murder - suicide, my second girlfriend had been raped twice ( or that may be a lie, as she was a manipulator, but that's another fantastic story ). home life became worse. my mother would explode over anything, and i would be the target. the vast majority of the time, it was emotional abuse, but every so often it would be physical as well, until one day she leapt on top of me to start a flurry of hits, and i kicked her across the room. [ 2005 - 2008 ]. i no longer spent time at home much, preferring to distract myself either with my real friends, or with the not - so - great ones along with all their drugs. everything around me started to degrade as well, and friends started dying. the first to die was the first friend i made when we moved, and the one who helped me in my first real fist fight at school ; his brother shot him. the rest to follow died of overdoses, and there were many. i abused drugs non - stop, daily. i never really got into hard drugs such as opiates or benzos, but i did come close to a cocaine addiction, and i was certainly an alcoholic and abuser of every psychedelic i learned the name of ( taking as an escape, in the wrong set and settings ). i fell in love with someone during this time, and she also had an abusive mother. we spent nearly every waking hour with each other, and often stayed the night at each others'houses when our moms worked. eventually, she moved in with me at our house due to her own abuse problems. about two months later, my mom was kicking us out. this was fine ; we had intended to find work in florida. i also swore that i would never, ever be near my mother again. my drug abuse became casual use, and i mostly just smoked pot after a hard day's work, and tripped once or twice a year in healthy settings. [ 2009 ]. we soon found ourselves living on the beach in a beautiful, but expensive condo. i was working, she was not. she became increasingly distant and overweight, and eventually she decided to leave me for the military ( although they really gave her a hard time about the weight, and forced her to train beforehand ). she wrote me for several months, was discharged due to an injury, and she ran to austin, texas. i don't know what happened to her there, and it doesn't matter ; all i know is that i had to rescue her with a lot of money, and that she no longer loved me. after she broke up with me, i spiraled out of control. i moved in with my father and worked for him. i blew everything i had on booze and drugs. i completely let myself go for three years, loving and trusting no one. i eventually drank myself into a near - fatal case of delerium tremons. it was at this point that i knew i had to go back to georgia, to return to my real friends and to try another hand at college. october, 2012. my mother had just bought a large house, and my father and i helped her move in. i wanted an mri badly due to fears of brain damage and to discover the root to the excruciating pain in my right eye and ear. my mother begged and manipulated me to stay, and we settled on her treating me to an mri as a deal. the mri didn't come for months, but when i eventually had it done, i was revealed to be fine albeit with intercranial pressure on my acoustic and optical nerves. the hearing loss was permanent, but the neurologist claimed the rest had nothing to do with my previous abuses. sure, whatever, i'm going off topic ; that problem has been fixed. [ 2013 ]. i've been mostly drug - free, with the occasional trip. i've been rising to the top quickly in the company i work for, but am still living at my mom's house, as well as my best friend and his wife. my mom has been going senile, and not a day has gone by without her verbally abusing anyone she can find in the house. everyone has taken to barricading themselves in their rooms ; not pleasant. i was saving to go back to college again, and to find a place of my own, until yesterday. she had decided to kick our two friends and room mates, claiming they did nothing ( bullshit! they landscaped, cooked, cleaned, etc. ) when they were leaving, this cosmic joked continued : his clutch line broke. she started verbally abusing me, and i kept walking away. i told her to get away from me, then she threw a phone at me in rage. damn near broke my collarbone ; fucking hurts. this was the last straw ; i was calling the police. i had the number in, but my friend stopped me. i went in to work, but everyone knew something was wrong, and i just broke down crying... they sent me home for the night. i swore i'd never move in with her again, i fucking swore it, and here i am, i have to postpone my enrollment today and focus on finding a house with my two friends. i am so hurt. i am so lonely. i hope i never become this way, ever, when i find love again. p. s. sorry if this was incoherent. i'm writing on - the - fly and not going to do any major proofreading or edits ; i just want to let it out.","1pdoh8","","3","3","1382960229","Assistance","-0.145189010989"

"survivorsofabuse","throwawaye2756839","our first really full time sharing of of my own story is conducted outside of all my close friends though and through their family. ( to only mention possible smoke gas trigger withdrawal warnings )","okay, i'm not really sure how to actually type this out. i almost never open up about this, it's always uncomfortable and i feel like no one really gets what it's like to have been through abuse when i try to tell them about it. the few friends i've told have sympathy, but they'll act like they're walking on eggshells around me a good while after i tell them until we kind of just forget about the conversation. i was sitting in bed and thinking about how i've never talked to anyone who had a similar experience to mine, and i think i might find some comfort in that, or maybe some people i can relate to with the matter. i don't know. so, when i was 4 years old, my mom's boyfriend at the time molested me. she met him online, and there was a considerable age difference. after she'd been dating him for a while, she finally felt comfortable letting him watch me and my 2 brothers while she went out to do errands. one of these times it was just me and him, and i was playing my new little mermaid video game i was really excited about. i don't remember much, but i have a crystal clear memory of him getting very close to my face and saying, "" if you tell anyone, i'm gonna kill your momma. "" with a smile. and my mom told me years later when i was a teenager that when she came home that day i was crying and telling her how much i loved her. some time then passed, and i told my cousin about it when we were taking a bath together, and my aunt overheard. that's how it got around with the family. the man who did something this to me got banned from living in our county and put on the sex offenders registry, and my family later found out that he'd done the same to other kids, meeting moms online who had young children. now i'm going to talk about what gets to me the most : the aftermath. i'm 18 now. once every few years, it'll come up and i'll talk about it with my mom. she doesn't believe i've suppressed the memory because after that it happened, i started having frequent nightmares and she would hear me cry in my sleep. she feels like the shittiest mom in the world, and it hurts me so much to see her think like that. there is nothing she could've done, and i try so hard to convince her that it could have happened just as easily to someone else. and i feel like because of this happening to me, my entire family is really sensitive towards me. i can't really explain it because its been this way all my life, but i can't help but feel like things would be way different, that i would be way different if it hadn't happened. like a lot of victims of childhood sexual abuse, i got too sexually inappropriate too early, and a completely warped idea of sexuality. this went on until i was about 14. also, i can't stand people touching my without permission or getting too close or i'll feel like i can't breath. and i've never trusted men, sometimes even family members. i get anxiety if i'm in the same room alone with a guy over like 25 in the same room as me. i feel like because this happened to me that mentally i didn't develop properly sexually or something, and i identify as asexual now. i lost my virginity a few months ago, just to get it over with, and now i don't think i'd want to do it again. being exposed to sexual things that early and warping my view on the matter, sex has always been a terrifying thing to me, and i just really wish i was normal and wanted it like other people my age do. i worry about ever being in a serious relationship because i won't have sex with them or i won't enjoy it. i have nights like this where i get to thinking and wonder if it'll ever happen, because i feel like no one could ever actually love me because of this messed up part of me that i carry around. survivors of childhood sexual abuse who grew up and had healthy relationships, how did you work through it? all this being said, this is just something i think about a lot and i decided to write it down and see if anyone else is the same. i'm sorry that it's kind of a hot mess, i just wanted to get all of it out for once, i've never shared this much of it with anyone before. most of the time i feel like i am over it, but a lot of times i wonder how i would have ended up if this had never happened to me.","2rhth7","","6","1","1420530164","","0.00245476190476"

( main details in post. )","his wife of ~ 7 years is 15 years older than him, and suckered him into marrying him with the "" i need a knight in shining armor "" bs. she has 4 older kids ( teens and early 20s ) from a previous marriage, all delinquents that act out and are just generally not parented well. there's no love in the marriage, and the only sex was to produce children. ( he has 3 kids with her, all very young and well behaved, quite different from the older 4 of hers. if it was up to him he would not have had any kids with her to limit the ties, but she surprised him with all three, and her family is apparently just very fertile. ) they all live together in an inner - city box of an apartment, all except for the wife's eldest daughter, who was kicked out of the house for her extreme delinquency. she is an abusive manipulation queen, and literally batshit insane. she's prone to fits of anger, jealousy, threats, and even lying to get her way. she's poisoned her own 4 kids against him ( the eldest of whom is actually pretty close in age to my friend, who's 27 ), and they hate him and have even called the cops on him themselves just to show him they can. and the wife told him if he ever went to the police about * her *, she'd muster together a whole load of people to lie in court for her and say that he beats her, when it's the other way around. when she found out that he told the kids'social worker that she forbade his parents from seeing their grandkids, she hit him and almost broke his nose. and that's not the first time. she tries to control everything he does, even to the point of forbidding him from calling his family. he's lost all his friends and everyone he knew, because his wife keeps tabs on his internet usage, phone, where he goes, etc. she claims she has "" spies "" in the community, and it may not be far from the truth. most recently, she took away and hid his phone and laptop, so he's stuck contacting me either at work or via gaming platforms that have email capabilities. the only real reason i'm even able to be in touch with him is because he has a secret email adress she doesn't know about. he's gotten to the breaking point where he knows he has to get away from her, but he wants to protect his children. if he leaves and his 3 little ones remain in her custody, she'll find a way to cut him off from them forever and corrupt their lives and behavior like her other 4 spawnlings. and since he can't afford legal advice ( she steals money from him too, so whatever he earns goes into bills or a black hole ), he has no recourse if she decides to "" punish "" him by turning her lying mob on him and getting him wrongly arrested for abusing her. the previous arrests, thanks to her and her kids, already screwed up his ability to get a couple of better jobs, so her antics have been taking a horrible toll on every aspect of his life. i'm now the only friend he has any contact with right now, since he's literally cut off from the rest of the world and anyone his wife doesn't "" approve "" of personally ( which means nobody ). is there anything i can do to help him take a more concrete step in the right direction ( away from her and out of that damn house ), in a way that would ensure he'll at least have a fair chance at getting custody of his kids? are there places that offer free legal advice and help for people like him who are literally stuck? i don't know his home phone or address, so i don't have the option of calling any hotlines on his behalf right now. if that's something i should do, please let me know and i'll at least try to get his home info, but i'm afraid it would just send her into a worse fit against him if it's not handled properly. please advise, redditors. i've known this guy for over 20 years, so i know he's not just simply being a "" pussy "" here and not putting his foot down. she really has him by the balls, and there's very little he can actually do without a backlash that would make the situation worse and hurt him or his kids. this woman has sucked the life out of life for him, and it's painful to just watch from the sidelines. sorry for the length, but the subreddit info said to give as much detail as possible, so i hope i'm not tl ; dring anyone. i just don't know where to turn.","k9oi1","","10","3","1315542242","","-0.0370564102564"

"survivorsofabuse","ugh_my_brain","here we go again. another holiday, another e - a mail from around my abusive abusive mother. and i am only barely done holding it ourselves together.","i need to get this off my chest. i'm in therapy, i have been for a long time with some great people helping me and my spouse is incredibly supportive, but i've never reached out to other people who could directly relate to my story. i'm sorry it's a bit long but if anything about my story resounds with yours and you'd like to talk about it in a positive, healing discussion then please feel free to comment or pm. i'm in my first year attending one of the best phd programs in my field and, as if that weren't stressful enough, i'm having trouble keeping things together this year with my mother e - mailing me around the holidays. my mother, from the time when i was a little girl to when i ran away from home just after my eighteenth birthday, has been an incredibly destructive force in my life. she alienated me from her family, changed our names after her divorce so that my father's family would not be able to contact us which resulted in my never meeting my aunt and meeting my ailing paternal grandmother just once before she passed on, moved us to a rural area that made it impossible for me to interact with friends without her explicit permission and generally made life difficult until i moved out when i turned 18. she is a terribly complex, unhappy person who has, throughout my entire life, spent her time bouncing from job to job, from church to church and from friend group to friend group until the entire community rejected her as an unpredictable nutcase. i know very little about her background between the beginning of her graduate schooling and the point 15 years later that she began living in my hometown. her former husband ( my step - father ) believes strongly that she was an intelligence operative in the cia and is suffering from ptsd despite the lack of any objective evidence. i know that she has repeatedly concocted insane stories to make me look like a little shit or escape from some type of responsibility so i think her story is a cover for her severe mental illness. i'm not close enough to her parents to ask their opinion - - she ruined my relationship with them quite a long time ago by convincing them that i'm a heartless, cunning atheist who told lies about being abused. it breaks my heart that, to this day, they believe her stories and despite seeing so much evidence of her insanity since she moved to their town and despite seeing that i have led a successful career in which i devote an extraordinarily large amount of time to assisting and mentoring disadvantaged students and ensuring that my research directly addresses the growing resource needs of humanity in a compassionate way. i love many things about people and, despite how poorly i've been treated by my own family, i continue to believe that we're a species worth fighting for. this belief is sometimes the thing that keeps me going day - to - day. that my family can't see this about me and instead continues to believe that i wrongfully abandoned my mother is probably the issue i grapple with most often. the memories of my childhood mostly consist of flashbacks of negative experiences, various incidents in which i was belittled, my judgment and needs questioned and explained as inappropriate or inconsequential compared to those of my mother, my self - image maligned and my goals and aspirations ridiculed. she constantly attempted to rework my identity into something she approved of and, to this day, i still have trouble discerning "" is this a hobby / career which i actually enjoy or something which was forced upon me when i was young? "" or "" is this an appropriate judgment to make about this person or has my mother's paranoia taught me an inappropriate response which i need to analyze and potentially discard? "". thank goodness i have always been a perceptive person with innate emotional intelligence otherwise i think i would have committed suicide long ago after growing weary of these difficult internal discussions. the details of the experiences aren't important as, unfortunately, i'm sure many of you understand the themes very well. being screamed at often and having my school reports or projects edited against my will were frequent experiences. so was being forced to dress up in the same outfits my mother would wear and being hit with a hair brush if i failed to comply. having privileges taken away unjustly for expressing rational dissent was also common - - this rigmarole was my mother's preferred method of ensuring i never interacted with new children whom i wanted to befriend but whose parents she didn't trust. the lowest moment of my existence was attending some type of d. a. r. e. class when i was in middle school which also touched on warning signs of abuse at home, innocently telling my mother after the class that i thought i was being abused based on what the teachers told us and, in response, being whacked across the head and arms as she said "" no, this is abuse "". my mother could never take any criticism or be held accountable for any of her actions. enemies were everywhere and, ultimately, i became an enemy "" possessed by the devil "" for defying her. so, fast forward to today. i eschew any form of contact with my mother and accept that she should play absolutely no role in my life. the only exception is keeping her e - mail address unblocked in case of emergency, something i'm reconsidering now that she lives with her family and there's nothing i could / would do anyway short of sending flowers to someone's funeral. over the last couple of months, she has been e - mailing me pictures of her and the rest of the family at birthday or holiday dinners and "" wishing me well "". i think this is grand standing rather than something signaling positive change since she cc's everyone else in the family and always angles for a reply from me. today, she asked for my address so she will know where to send holiday and birthday gifts. she's been upset over the past few years that i would not give her my home address. ( my spouse and i had to kick her out of our apartment complex after she refused to leave, our last major interaction with her. she has an obsession with cleaning which she uses to access the private areas of people's homes and wouldn't stop trying to pick up things in our bedroom and closets! growing up, i would often come home to face punishment after one of her infamous cleaning sessions to see my private journal sprawled out and obviously read or political books i had hidden laid out on my desk. and yes, for those of you wondering, she was a rabid conservative and fundamentalist christian who would not let me read john kerry's biography openly or other "" objectionable "" material. ) this act with holiday gifts is something that has always confused me a bit but i chalk it up to her need to appear to be a good parent. i say this because my spouse and i tried for nearly two years to have limited, structured contact with her and, despite everything we did with the guidance of my therapist, she never changed. she would always say something terribly fucked up about the past near the end of a meal i. e.

"survivorsofabuse","soathrowawayy","how to my date as a black male domestic abuse rape survivor, and how to not deal with it in general today i guess.","i was physically and emotionally abused by my father from the age of about 6 to about 15, at which point it became less frequent and i had more agency as a teenager. usually, he would yell at me, slap me in the face really hard, kick me, and hit my head against the floor when he got angry, which was probably once every few months. other things he's done include breaking a plastic box over my head, hitting me with a belt, punching me in the stomach and knocking the wind out of me, and making me get naked and take a cold shower in front of him. there are way more things to mention. the verbal stuff was the worst. he would yell at me and berate me for hours, and say all kinds of mean sarcastic things, and really put me down. sometimes he yelled at me or hit me in public. there was no way to get out of it until he decided to stop. he always treated me like a bad kid, even though i didn't get into trouble much and had pretty good grades. i was the leader of a couple major extra - curricular groups in school, and just graduated college with two engineering degrees in four years. i got a pretty good job out of college and just moved away from my parents about a month ago. i'm 22 right now. it really sucks not having a loving and supportive family. i don't know if i'll talk to them or see them much anymore. i've also never had a girlfriend or had sex with anyone. i'm decently socially normal and can makes jokes if i'm in a good mood, and some female friends probably have said that they find me hot, but i don't know how true it is and i'm really worried. there have been some threads here where girls talk about their boyfriends holding them and comforting them while they share stories of abuse, and i don't know if a girl would do that for me or find a man who needed that attractive, even though she might be able to empathize. people say over and over that girls find confident guys with healthy self - esteem attractive, and i've had so much confidence and self - esteem taken from me. in any relationship, i'll have this huge stigmatizing emotional bomb to drop about my past abuse and family issues, in addition to not having dated anybody yet at this age. i don't even really know what confidence is. i stand up for myself and am resilient and hardworking, but i'm also pretty insecure and worried and it shows sometimes. sometimes i'll be really depressed around friends or coworkers. a few times i've started crying in public, like at a train station or something. so basically any advice would be appreciated. there's the family you're born with and the family you choose, and it doesn't seem like either is going to work out for me. a life without love isn't really worth it. also, i've been reading books and seeing a therapist, so i am trying to work on this.","2c3occ","","11","13","1406685169","","-0.0688586206897"

their grandmother is an addict, their other grandparents are living off welfare and unable / unsafe homes for the children. all 4 children have separate fathers, and all are unsuitable homes ( her step - father is the best, but he's flat broke and doesn't have a home ). my husband's other siblings, excluding theresa are all addicts, or unsuitable homes due to other reasons. which leaves theresa, and ourselves. renee has 3 beautiful children ( samantha, 5, billy, 10, and karly, 14 ). they currently spend one week with renee and one week with their father, luke. this is the week they're with luke. renee has the 4 kids for an indefinite amount of time, which means that at some points, she'll have 7 children she's caring for all by herself. we're not really able to take them. we live in a 3 bedroom, single bathroom, one lounge room, one kitchen house with our housemate. it's small enough that the three of us feel a bit crowded as it is, and the house is full to bursting when company comes over. we don't have a bed for the kids to use, we can't afford food, and heck, we don't even know how to care for them ( sure, we've babysat, but never a 1 year old, and never for longer than a night ). so, if she's arrested and the children are taken away, how and where are they going to live? i'm glad they're being taken away, but coming from a bad home myself, i chose to live with the beatings rather than be homeless. being injured and hungry, but warm and comfortable was better than cold, hungry, and with nowhere to go. we need to be in court in 7 1 / 2 hours. to testify. to top it all off, i'm on my period, i'm extremely hormonal ( like 1000x more than usual, i cried because the cat wouldn't sit on my lap a couple days ago ), i'm in constant pain, and i'm writing this at 2 : 30am on the first anniversary of my wedding. plus, my husband and i are flat broke because he lost his job because of medical issues. i'm still waiting on the government to grant me work rights. we spend literally $ 20 / week on food. we're nearly $ 1200 behind on rent, which is great that our housemate owns the house and doesn't need us to pay, it's just a perk for him ( plus he's my husband's best mate ). god, what do i do? how am i supposed to cope with this? i can't even handle my own emotions right now, i'm not sure how i kept smiling for the kids. god, but this is the second time i've ever even met them, and please, please, help me. * edited because i can't keep names straight when i try to change them *","17t5oi","","8","8","1359906389","","-0.0311189189189"

"survivorsofabuse","Bonnie_1989","help learning what is considered normal","hey guys! i've been wondering if there is a place somewhere here or elsewhere on the net where you can ask how things should be. like, after this event i felt like this, is that normal, what would a healthy response be? someone i know did this and even though it doesn't seem that weird, it made me feel queasy, how should i feel as a normal, healthy adult? how do healthy people experience love? how should i apologise for this, how often? is it normal to do these things, or is it a problem i have to address? i'm crying about this, but don't quite understand why, how would others feel in this situation? i did this and this was my parent's / so's response, is it normal to react that way? why did they say this or that? am i overreacting / underreacting? etc.... i very often feel very alone and don't know who to ask these q's or who to talk to. my friends try their best, but sometimes they don't understand where i'm coming from. i kinda feel that due to having grown up in an abusive household i lack knowledge that my parents should have provided but instead filled my head with screwed up world views. i do try to learn things, but i very often have difficulties and it would help just to ask and have someone explain ideally, this and that should be the case, or this kinda sounds serious, maybe you should try and deal with it in this way etc... i'll give one example : one of the many therapists i have gone to asked me if i had children or if i had regular contact to any kids. i said i didn't, which at the time was true but now has changed. he's a 16y old boy, we're not directly related, but family and he calls me his sister, which is technically not correct, but i try being a good bigger sister ( i'm 25, if that matters ). the therapist wanted to know because of the cycle of abuse. since i have not learned how to interact with children / teenagers in a healthy way it would be better not to have much contact, so as not to, let's say, spread the physical abuse ( i kinda like thinking of abuse as some sort of infection, like a cold sore. i have the virus in me and every now and then i have a break out and it can get contagious.... anyway ). now his sister ( 30 ) told me that her birthday gift to him on his 16th birthday was a kama sutra book. she explains it with back when she was that age her group of friends would give each other a'teenager survival kit'with condoms, tampons, kama sutra books etc and that she didn't want to embarrass him so she didn't give him condoms, just the book. that made me very uncomfortable. i thought it was totally inappropriate, but how could i find out if my gut feeling was right or if i'm just overly cautious. and what, if anything, i should do about it..... she has also experienced abuse in her childhood and she is not very emotionally smart. so, my question is if there is a place like that, or if anyone would be interested if i created a subr for those kinds of questions. please let me know","2y6ofs","","7","2","1425682385","","0.0737"

( this had been what was going on the last few months and i was so unaware of it ).... my then 16 year old sister had then went to the kitchen, and taken every single sharp knife that we had and brought them up to her room where she sat on the floor waiting for my dad to come up so that she could stab him. she had completely broken down from him. the next day, i stood in the kitchen beside my brother, both so so unaware of this hell that had been going on. we were told my my mam that she didn't want to ruin another xmas for us so didn't say anything about these events that were occuring all the time in the last few months. we were utterly shocked. i had been in this lovely bubble for the few days i was home thinking finally we were an ok kind of family. it was so wrong. i sorted out the whole mess, told my dad he could stay and i would go to the doctor with him for help with the alcohol abuse / antidepressants ( as he said that was the issue ). sorted out my sister and mam, brought them off for new years etc. my mam just smiled along and thanked me, telling me that she had finally realised that drink was now banned in "" this "" house and will never ever be seen around her again. told me that she was finally free of my dad and spoke of how she would give him two months to seek help and then ask him to leave the house. she told me she had no more love for him and they were over. she thanked me for sorting out the mess yet again...... as time went on my dad stayed in the house ( minus the drinking ) which was brilliant. one whole year passed where he never drank, my mother apparently didn't too. last year it all seemed to be looking up... however, i'm not stupid and for the last two years, i have been anxious, had nightmares, and have become a very different person. i live in constant fear that this will happen again. every few nights i have a dream about the abuse that i have witnessed in the past. i can't be happy. they just keep letting me down. i brought my sister to my house in the city this summer. she stayed from monday - friday and she got the bus home to them at the weekend. from the day she left, they started drinking again. by the last week ( week 3 ), she had been gone about 14 nights. they had built up so many bottles of wine that the dog house was full of bottles. it started again, i came home two weeks later ( about 2months ago now )... unannounced and found empty bottles everywhere. my sister confessed that they were up drinking around the house at night. she said to me that she did not want me to say anything because she couldn't cope with the drama / mess / fighting it would cause if i interveened again. i went home this weekend.... any time i go home at the weekend i stay at home if they go out to the pub. my best friend was having a birthday getogether and wanted me to come out too. my mam and brother begged me to come out and asked "" why would you not come, what is wrong with you? "". i kept saying no until my sister ( now 17 ) said that she would like to go out too for a little while ( not drinking ) and go home then. so i gave in and got ready. the start of the night was fine. i drank a lot more than i should. by the end of the night i was very drunk ( as too were my brother, mam and dad ) my brother's girlfriend - who i know and love was there. i went completely mad and started on her. calling her names and asking why she was always in our house. ( this is completely not me ) my dad freaked at me. then i freaked at him. i started yelling all the things he had ever done to us in the pub on front of a few other people. we went home and the yelling continued. my sister was asleep at this stage. i kept going, keep yelling and shouting at him and my mam ( i was so crazy with drink ). my brother was trying to calm the situation. i ( in my drunken state, wanted my brother to be angry at them too ) and so i told him something awful that my parents had done when we were younger. my brother flipped and broke mirrors, ornaments in the house. i then called the cops... ( in all the history of abuse in my house, i never had the balls to do that, so it is considered very bad to my parents and sister that i would do that ) they came,. and did nothing much... i went to my room and slept for 3 hours. i woke up, my dad had woke the whole house and was up shouting about me and what i had done. i grabbed my things ( called my boyfriend ) and we went back to my flat in the city ( about 2 1 / 2 hours drive ) my mam rang me about 30mins later saying that i was mad / everything was my fault / never talk to them again. i text my sister and apologised and asked her to send me one message so i knew she was okay but she has not replied... my boyfriend told me not to worry ( he hates them for everything they have done ) and my brother has pretty much continued with his week. i am sitting here, not knowing what to do. the only person i care about is my sister, and she hates me now? they have framed me, called me crazy and will now probably continue with their drinking... as it doesn't seem as bad as what i did the other night..... i really haven't got anyone to talk to. i hate my family, but did not need to bring this on them. if i was worried about the recent evidence of drinking i should have confronted them again. but it didn't. it's all such a mess. i cannot continue with my life right now... tldr : got really drunk and called the cops on my abusive parents ( but was uncalled for at this time ). parents think i'm scum for doing this and sister thinks i'm crazy and won't talk to me.","2kocc7","","5","1","1414591797","[new]","-0.0833428571429"

( after writing this i realize it may be pointless back story, so you can probably skip ahead to the bullet points ) my sister's and i's living situation growing up wasn't the best, i left home when i graduated hs and ended up going overseas. basically i didn't really see my sister for 10 - ish years. i got married and we decided to invite my side of the family to the wedding and that leads to me decided to re - connect with them. we ended up living in the same state so i saw some of my nephew and sister and her then husband at family stuff, and things seemed a little off in the family ( kid ridiculously well behaved for how the parents would act, really quiet, didn't seem to like playing with the other kids in the family ) and my sister has always been less than what i would call responsible in choosing partners. anyway, she'd been asking me to baby sit him more often and he ended up staying with us for 3 or 4 months at one point. me and my partner were looking at trying to get custody, but i ended up going back over seas, and since my so wasn't a blood relative there were issues and my sister and a different guy ended up taking him back. when i got back stateside we looked into getting custody again, and a whole legal mess happened. luckily, because my nephew had tried to make a claim with his school counselor while oversease ( which the counselor totally ignored, btw, but it was on file at least ), we were able to start an investigation which turned up a whole mess of stuff - neglect ( which we expected ), physical and sexual abuse from both my sister and her boyfriend ( which we did not ) and i got kinship custody. there was some talk of prosecuting, but he went down for unrelated charges and the lawyers didn't feel like we had a strong enough case against just my sister. we do definitely not have contact with her, though she has done some "" stalking "" off and on in the past years. me and my partner have been trying really hard in the past few years to provide a safe and nurturing home. it was really tough at first, especially since i'm really closer to him in age as a brother than like a dad or something, and we'd never had kid's or planned on it so the difficulty was mostly on our end at first. he's really intelligent and always seems to have cognitive grasp on what happened to him and it being not ok, hell, he probably understand the legal side of the custody agreement better than i do at this point. he was willing and able to talk about the abuse in therapy. he's in honor classes at school and has had no behavioral issues there. we didn't really have any behavioral issues when he moved in permanently, which really worried us because everything we read said that would probably happen, but we though maybe because he had lived with us previously the move would be easy or something. anyway, the issue is in the past few month he's been having a lot more trouble "" behavior "" wise at home, and ever time he does some thing "" wrong "", he tries to fix the situation by attempting to initiate sexual contact with me, and acting sexually inappropriate in general. for instance, if he forgets to do a chore, he'll try to blow me to make up for it. occasionally he has gotten very adamant about it, to the point of trying to force the issue physically. we've talked about how this is inappropriate, he cognitively knows that this isn't healthy and is a result of his abuse, but that hasn't had any effect on his behavior. so, - his abuse was a lot more extensive than i previously thought - he never broke any of the rules we laid down when he first moved in, so there is no standing method of discipline - i'm really hesitant to use any kind of discipline here because of the situation and what happened to him, i just don't know what would be affective here - i know he's doing this out of confusion - i know he's also trying to reach out for affection and this is just what he knows to do - he's in therapy individually and we also go together. he talks about this situation clinically when we're there, totally without emotion - nothing like this is showing up with people his age or younger ( thank whatever deity there is ), just adults that are close to him in an authority position, it doesn't seem to matter what gender i just really don't know how to handle the situation. i realize part of it is him pushing boundaries, seeing if i'm actually just waiting for enough misbehavior or "" invitations "" on his part to abuse him, and that if he acts out enough or come on to me strongly enough, then i'll abuse him and everything will go "" back to normal "", or i'll be to disgusted by him that i'll shut him off from affection completely ( paraphrasing something he said ) and he'll understand the situation again. but he also seems just genuinely really confused about how affection, especially physically affection works. how do i deal with episodes of this while still being there for him and not being stand offish? how do i make him know he's loved, but still try to correct the behavior that caused him to freak out and start being sexually inappropriate in the first place? also on a personal note, how do deal with this a person ( other than obviously not being evil. duh, or course i'm not gonna hurt the kid ) like to be real its kinda freaky and totally overwhelming that this is been happening for the last few months. help?","2axvyk","","5","3","1405589242","","-0.0416591836735"

"survivorsofabuse","melanieanne3505","how i definitely have started remembering certain familiar things that i find... kind... of disturbing and now i'm a whole little too freaked - out. ( x - post letter from adult survivors )","this is my first time in this sub but i'm so thankful it's here right now. about three years ago, i realized that i was transgender ( mtf ). i'm now currently in the process of transitioning and i've been thinking a lot about my childhood, trying to figure out why i'm in my 30's and just realizing that i'm trans. a few months ago, i "" remembered "" something odd. i put "" remember "" in quotes because this isn't something i've ever forgotten about, but i never really thought about it either. when i was younger, my older brother ( 5 years older ) used to do things with me. i can remember him having me give him blow jobs ( no idea that's what it was called back then ). he would always stop me before he "" peed "" in my mouth. this was usually in his bed hanging out in his room. i can't remember how many times it happened, but not that often. maybe 5? i also remember him doing things with me in the pool. it's vague, but i seem to remember him, with his swimsuit off, rubbing himself against me. almost kind of like pants - less dry humping? i was young when this was happening, but probably right around the time of puberty. i don't remember having erections or even if i could get erections at the time, but i definitely knew what he was doing was sexual. he would even masturbate right in front of me. not whipping it out and going at it, but he'd sit on the couch in the living room with a pillow over his crotch and you could clearly see the motions his hands were making under that pillow. as we got a little older, i specifically remember one instance where he came home from his girlfriends house. he was either 16 or 17 which would make me 11 or 12. he made me smell his fingers and told me that was from him fingering his girlfriend. actually, i think that same night is one of the nights he asked me to suck on him. i never said anything to anyone. i never protested to even him because he could be kind of abusive. i was never as macho as him and being five years younger i was never anywhere near as strong as him. he got pleasure from giving me "" dead legs "" or arms, indian burns, that sort of thing. i even remember on a car trip, him giving me a hard time, making fun of me, and punching me. i finally told my parents who were sitting right there in the front seat and they did one of those "" stop picking on your brother "" things. immediately after that, he punched me even harder and said "" that's what you get for telling on me "". oh yeah, there was also the time that i called him a "" ni * * er "" and in small town pa with dixie flags everywhere that was almost as bad as or worse than being called gay. we were out in the garage with concrete floors. he grabbed my neck and picked me up off of my feet. he held me there until i passed out. he dropped me and i hit my head on the ground. i had a huge goose egg for like a week because of that. it all started ( me calling him that ) after he finally let me out of the car trunk i had been locked in for the last 5 - 10 minutes. he was a bad boy so his relationship with my parents wasn't that great. as he got older he spent less and less time at home. we always alternated between being friendly and him being abusive. i always felt inferior to him as a "" man "" but at least i understand why that was now. i don't know that what he did made me feel uncomfortable at the time necessarily. which is maybe why i haven't thought about it very much over the years. but now yesterday, i started reading about the whole lana and grace dunham controversy and i'm seeing a lot of parallels here. was i sexually abused? i looked up some information about adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse and in my adult life, i seem to have a lot of the same issues as survivors ( i. e. depression, anxiety, low self esteem, guilt and shame, lack of trust, and, apparently, dissociation ). i mentioned i'm mtf though, and depression, anxiety, low self esteem, lack of trust, guilt and shame where all things i attributed to that. i had immense feelings of guilt and shame when i came out ( being raised in an extremely religious household will have that affect on you ). i never really trusted anyone because i didn't feel i could let me whole personality out ( after all, i was acting as a male - look too close and the facade might crumble ). i don't think what he did "" made me "" trans though. i believe being transgender is a birth defect and therefore i've been trans my whole life. but thinking about it now, i do think the whole thing had a lot to do with how i developed into a person and i don't mean that in a good way. now for the worst part? i ended up doing the same thing. i had a neighbor that was 4 - 5 years younger than me. i grew up in a rural area so he was about the only option i had for a play mate. i know that with as much power as my brother held over me, i compensated by doing the same to my neighbor. we would play out in the woods a lot, and i eventually introduced a game where we would do things to each other. this definitely involved pulling our pants down. occasionally we would fondle each other and lick or kiss each other "" down there "". i never asked him to do something that i also wouldn't do. not that that makes it any better. that's also not entirely true. a few times i convinced him to "" lick my butt "", but i didn't want to do that so i used a leaf and pretended. wow, just getting that out, that is so perverse. i can't believe i did that. how badly did i fuck up his life? i don't live in the area anymore, but from what i hear, he never amounted to much. he did have an abusive ( physically, not sexually ) father and his parents ended up divorced so he had a lot going against him already. i guess i just added to the pile of fucked up shit that's happened to him. how do i make up for that? i can't imagine going to him in person now and trying to explain things, but i feel like i somehow have to atone for what i've done. i had no idea at the time, of course, that what was happening to me and what i was doing to him could be considered abuse, but looking back on it now, i really feel victimized by my brother and sadly, as an abuser to my neighbor. i've grown distant from my family over the last three years. they're "" supportive "" of me but have made it clear that they don't really want to talk about it or know anything about it. i live far enough away that i want to just write off the whole family. i don't feel any sort of kinship with them. i look at them as the people i lived with when i was growing up. even if i don't write off my parents completely, i really, at this point, want to write off my brother. i don't care if i ever see him again. the only thing stopping me from not seeing any of them is my kids. my wife doesn't want them to miss out on knowing their grandparents and uncle. am i making this all a much bigger deal than it is? to me, it's always seemed almost "" normal "" although i think deep down i knew it wasn't. reading about the dunam's and the internet's response to that makes me almost certain though. what does reddit think? was i abused? did i abuse my neighbor? please, people of reddit, jump in, tell me your thoughts on this whole big mess. i don't know what to think about it right now. it feels surreal.","2lkud3","","3","1","1415368486","","-0.0593313131313"

"survivorsofabuse","space-dyed_test","[ album x - post release from double r / depression ] so i need help coping after church my boyfriend tried to kill some me","i just found this subreddit, it looks like an incredible resource. maybe you can help me more than r / depression. my case wasn't exactly as extreme as most women i've heard about.. and there's more in my life that needs to be fixed than repercussions of the abuse. but it's definitely a huge part of it for me. it's been just over two months since my boyfriend went to jail. i feel like my entire world has been flipped upside down. and he recently started texting me from anonymous numbers against the no contact order... i was weak and responded a bit, but i didn't give him any information and i stopped. i just need fucking closure. it's so hard to resist talking to him. every single night since they took him away in a police car and told me i can never see him again, all i've dreamed of is seeing him. talking to him. one way or another, in my dreams we get to be together. and during the day i hate myself for missing a monster so much. i don't know how to cope with all these conflicting emotions. i never learned as a kid how to face and deal with emotions.. this is a true tests of myself. i don't think i can do it alone. the first two weeks i felt truly insane, i felt like i couldn't find the ground, i was just spinning wildly in space.. i'm starting to find myself again, but there's still so much damage. where do i begin the healing? anyway, here is my original post to / r / depression - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - okay.. where to start. i've always viewed myself as a strong person. i think my friends would identify me as one as well. they have before. but.. i'm only strong in that i don't let negative events in my life define me. i don't face them and overcome them, i just tell myself okay.. this isn't going to change my real life. it's what i did when i was molested by a family friend my mom trusted. it's what i did when my dad disappeared for years of my life to use / sell heroin and i never knew if he was going to be alive or dead the next day. those things have just been sitting with me.. things i choose not to acknowledge but i know they exist. i'm sorry if this seems incoherent. so.. anyway. by some series of stupid decisions, last year i found myself ( unhappily ) married and moved into a new apartment. as my marriage went downhill, i befriended the neighbor. we got closer and closer, staying up all night drinking and just talking. he knew me better than anyone had ever known me before. all he had to do was look at me and he could read my mind. it was kind of creepy how accurate he could be. but it was nice, you know? to have someone know you so intimately. i had never had that before.. anyway, i'm not very good at making friends, so my husband encouraged me to be vulnerably honest with this guy as that's a good way to earn someone's trust. i wanted to start a new chapter in my life, an open and friendly chapter. so i took a leap of faith and told this guy everything, we were completely honest and open with each other. more than i had ever been with anyone, before or since. eventually... i left my husband, and obviously sought comfort in my neighbor friend. it was great, at first. he took me to the beach almost every day. he showed me some beautiful new music. we had fun forgetting our troubles together. but.. somewhere along the way things changed. he started using how well he knew me against me. he started manipulating me, slowly, i didn't even realize it. he started controlling my life with suicide threats and alcohol and sleep deprivation.. it's such a long story i can't get into right now. i'm about to go to work. after dating for about four months, we got in some stupid scuffle over i don't even know what and he ended up pushing me around and putting me in a choke hold for about one second that i slipped out of. it all happened so fast, i didn't even really comprehend it. i went home, crying and called my best friend and she came over with cheese cake and mace. the next morning, he minimized it and turned it around and i was so confused and caught up in his web, i questioned the truth and thought okay.. but if you ever put your hands on me again, i'm fucking out of here. i'm a strong woman, right? i don't let people push me around. but i'm not a drama queen either, i don't make a big deal out of nothing. at this point, i could no longer tell the difference between nothing and something. about two months later, in early december, i had become fed up of his constant negativity. it was taking a toll on my life in so many ways. i had quit my job because of him, been unemployed for over a month, trying to pay rent on a two person apartment because my husband had moved out. i was incredibly depressed ( as i have been most of my life, but now it was exacerbated ) and i didn't know what to do. i told him i just needed to be in the forest for a while, he can come if he wants but i'm going either way. he ended up going, and complaining and saying negative things the entire time. the point was just to sit, and heal. so i got mad.. yelled at him.. got in this big fight.. he cried, i dropped him off at home and i drove away so i he wouldn't suck me back in. i cried at a different park for a while before going home. a few hours later, maybe midnight, he comes banging on my door very obviously drunk. he was a terrible alcoholic and instead of acknowledging it, i just avoided hanging out with him when he had been drinking. he had a red box movie and an apology, and i hadn't seen him since our fight so i decided to let him in and make him leave after the movie. he drunkenly talked loudly / snored throughout the entire movie. by the time it was over, i was ready for him to leave. he didn't want to leave. long story short, he ended up threatening my life about five seconds before trying to strangle me to death. i escaped and ran naked to my neighbors house, banging on his door until he let me in so i could call the cops. i haven't seen him since he looked at me with murderous eyes. other than in court, but we aren't allowed to talk to each other because of the no contact order ( which he broke recently by sending me'anonymous'texts, which have completely thrown me for a whole new loop in the healing process. i can go into that more after work. ). so anyway... i guess. it's been really fucking hard to cope with this. i feel like he was violently ripped out of my life, and i never got the chance to address it and overcome it. i can't talk to him and ask him what the hell he was thinking. i feel like i can't get closure. and i have all these conflicting emotions.. i hate him for betraying my trust, for playing me solely for his own enjoyment, for using me to have some feeling of control. i hate myself for putting myself in this position. i should be smarter that that, only weak women let something like this happen to them.. i thought. but part of me loves him, or maybe is just still brainwashed? i just.. i can't unpack all the emotions inside of me. i don't know how to look at them and see them for what they are. even if i could, i don't think i can trust myself to interpret things correctly. my entire perception of reality has been flawed by this guy. i don't know what's true anymore. i don't know what to trust. i can't trust myself, or anyone else. and my friends just don't understand at all. they say things like its all about your mind set, don't let it own you, don't let it define you, you'll get over it, you just need time. but they're so fucking wrong. i need more than that. i need to understand what the fuck is wrong with me that made me think this was okay. i need to be able to recognize the ways in which i was broken so i can begin to fix them. i need.. guidance. i tried going to a support group. it helped hearing all the other women's stories, horror stories. so much worse than what i went through, but sounded like the exact same man. every story was an identical man. that was helpful, in reminding me that i can never go back to him and i should never want to. but overall, the group wasn't that helpful. i needed more one on one help. so i went to a therapist. but she obviously didn't care about me. it was all so stuffy and clinical. i was just "" patient "" not treated like a self aware human. i was prescribed generic'help'options. maintain a job, do things that make you happy, decrease stress levels... fuck you. i don't just need superficial feel - good solutions to minimize the pain. no one understands that i just need to understand!! wow this was a long ramble. i have to go to work... i guess my main point / question is... where can i get real help for this? i have been completely unsupported, after being brainwashed into relying completely and entirely on one person. i feel like i'm tumbling around inside a giant dryer trying to gain some sort of perspective, but nothing sticks. idk. i need help. not just with this event, with everything that has happened in my life. i need the tools to be a better person. i need to unpack myself and look at all the broken parts and know how to fix them. i have no idea how to go about this. i feel so lost. i feel like i'll never get back on track. i feel like i'm just going to be slightly broken and alone forever.","2vyg3z","","4","12","1423988477","","-0.0280717105263"

( something which he himself does all the time ) after my mother defended him, dad left, and i've hardly seen him since then. now that the physical force used against me has stopped, it has become far more sinister and twisted. he has been waiting in the dark for me to leave my room at night, told my mother i attempted to stab him and turning the power off, and the internet off intermittently when he doesn't get his way. he also listens in on my phonecalls, enters my room when i'm away ( despite the fact that there is a lock, he must have a copy of my key ), records me whenever i'm doing anything he disagrees with ( cooking at 10pm ) and vandalizing my property. i am old and mature enough now to know that after a physical confrontation, calling the police home will solve my problems for the most part. but now that he cannot over - power me, i do not know what i am to do. i cannot afford to move out, and all of my free time i hide in my room for fear of ridicule or anything else. what can i do to someone who is no longer physically abusive, when my mother will not intervene / her intervention ( which is not much ) has not yielded any results from a spoilt child? i looked in to what government payments i can get if i have to leave, but i can only acquire those after i have been forced out of my home. and the last thing i want to do is leave my home. are there any strategies i can implement to help myself? is there anything i can do to help my mother realise that my brother's behaviour is far from normal? can you think of anything to help me? thankyou for any and all responses.","10vkw0","","3","9","1349276013","","-0.186616129032"

"domesticviolence","NoOneCanKnowMyName","bad late mother style issues.","i am about to reveal a lot of personal information about myself and my mother's history, so if anyone i know just happens to read this... you'll probably figure out who i am. i'm not sure where to begin ; i suppose it will be with a basic history of my mother : she is 65, nearing retirement in her field, and batshit insane. the roots of evil were seeded when she was born into poverty as the fifth unwanted child. her uncle ( and possibly father ) molested her, her own mother once kicked her off the porch on a tricycle when she was a toddler, and overall was raised in a very violent household. her mother died of a heart attack at 45, and the two had never reconciled. she has hinted at, and i truly believe, that she hates all men. as a child, my sister and i were constant witnesses to the abuse of our father, and i distinctly remember how at an early age, she and i begged her to stop screaming at dad in the car. this tactic worked for a while, but she soon ignored our pleas and resumed the abuse. fast forward to 2001 : eight grade. my mother up an decided to move us to northern georgia on a whim, leaving my father to tend to his company in florida. it did not take long for her to choose me as the successor of abuse. i would be verbally assaulted, and on some occasions, tackled and beaten. adjusting to school was difficult. i always had been part of a relatively popular crowd in florida, and never had to stand up for myself ; my friends would do it for me. not so here. i was seen as an outsider, on the very first day of school made enemies. within a week i was having fist fights ; not allowing anyone to walk on me. i never made fun of anyone, nor taunted others. i always treated others the way i felt i should should be, and if they didn't treat me right, they'd hurt. by freshman year, the school had me barred from my most electives, and most people knew not to fuck with me by this point. it was lonely. i was always lonely. my first real girlfriend had her parents die in a murder - suicide, my second girlfriend had been raped twice ( or that may be a lie, as she was a manipulator, but that's another fantastic story ). home life became worse. my mother would explode over anything, and i would be the target. the vast majority of the time, it was emotional abuse, but every so often it would be physical as well, until one day she leapt on top of me to start a flurry of hits, and i kicked her across the room. [ 2005 - 2008 ]. i no longer spent time at home much, preferring to distract myself either with my real friends, or with the not - so - great ones along with all their drugs. everything around me started to degrade as well, and friends started dying. the first to die was the first friend i made when we moved, and the one who helped me in my first real fist fight at school ; his brother shot him. the rest to follow died of overdoses, and there were many. i abused drugs non - stop, daily. i never really got into hard drugs such as opiates or benzos, but i did come close to a cocaine addiction, and i was certainly an alcoholic and abuser of every psychedelic i learned the name of ( taking as an escape, in the wrong set and settings ). i fell in love with someone during this time, and she also had an abusive mother. we spent nearly every waking hour with each other, and often stayed the night at each others'houses when our moms worked. eventually, she moved in with me at our house due to her own abuse problems. about two months later, my mom was kicking us out. this was fine ; we had intended to find work in florida. i also swore that i would never, ever be near my mother again. my drug abuse became casual use, and i mostly just smoked pot after a hard day's work, and tripped once or twice a year in healthy settings. [ 2009 ]. we soon found ourselves living on the beach in a beautiful, but expensive condo. i was working, she was not. she became increasingly distant and overweight, and eventually she decided to leave me for the military ( although they really gave her a hard time about the weight, and forced her to train beforehand ). she wrote me for several months, was discharged due to an injury, and she ran to austin, texas. i don't know what happened to her there, and it doesn't matter ; all i know is that i had to rescue her with a lot of money, and that she no longer loved me. after she broke up with me, i spiraled out of control. i moved in with my father and worked for him. i blew everything i had on booze and drugs. i completely let myself go for three years, loving and trusting no one. i eventually drank myself into a near - fatal case of delerium tremons. it was at this point that i knew i had to go back to georgia, to return to my real friends and to try another hand at college. october, 2012. my mother had just bought a large house, and my father and i helped her move in. i wanted an mri badly due to fears of brain damage and to discover the root to the excruciating pain in my right eye and ear. my mother begged and manipulated me to stay, and we settled on her treating me to an mri as a deal. the mri didn't come for months, but when i eventually had it done, i was revealed to be fine albeit with intercranial pressure on my acoustic and optical nerves. the hearing loss was permanent, but the neurologist claimed the rest had nothing to do with my previous abuses. sure, whatever, i'm going off topic ; that problem has been fixed. [ 2013 ]. i've been mostly drug - free, with the occasional trip. i've been rising to the top quickly in the company i work for, but am still living at my mom's house, as well as my best friend and his wife. my mom has been going senile, and not a day has gone by without her verbally abusing anyone she can find in the house. everyone has taken to barricading themselves in their rooms ; not pleasant. i was saving to go back to college again, and to find a place of my own, until yesterday. she had decided to kick our two friends and room mates, claiming they did nothing ( bullshit! they landscaped, cooked, cleaned, etc. ) when they were leaving, this cosmic joked continued : his clutch line broke. she started verbally abusing me, and i kept walking away. i told her to get away from me, then she threw a phone at me in rage. damn near broke my collarbone ; fucking hurts. this was the last straw ; i was calling the police. i had the number in, but my friend stopped me. i went in to work, but everyone knew something was wrong, and i just broke down crying... they sent me home for the night. i swore i'd never move in with her again, i fucking swore it, and here i am, i have to postpone my enrollment today and focus on finding a house with my two friends. i am so hurt. i am so lonely. i hope i never become this way, ever, when i find love again. p. s. sorry if this was incoherent. i'm writing on - the - fly and not going to do any major proofreading or edits ; i just want to let it out.","1pdoh8","","3","3","1382960229","Assistance","-0.145189010989"

"survivorsofabuse","rubberslutty","so an ex alcoholic mother just being visited met herself by missing my house in case actual laws are for the the first time..","i really just need to all just get this off of my chest and sorry for ranting. i've truly been slightly estranged from my alcoholic and and yet verbally / emotionally abusive mother for the past 8. 5 years, in which time i have been through therapy and also met the love of my life. while my wife rachel and i have met mother and my awesome and completely too - good - for - her father a few times i actually finally felt... it was time for maybe them to meet under my inlaws of 4 years. understandably there was some tension in the air. fast forward to tonight. 4 hours before dinner my mother told for me she was concerned and still didn't want to come to my dinner because we would all view behind her as the monster in the living room. after my telling her she needed to make this up her mind she did come, but i could smell the alcohol before she even got out of the car. she needed my fathers help to walk straight, and continued to drink to the point that she couldn't remember my mother - in - laws name, and proceeded to simply fall asleep at the dinner table. it really felt like she had betrayed me in telling me that she was trying to get better and then wanted a fresh start. my in - laws are pure mortified, my father is beyond really pissed, i never want to see her again and am pretty sure why she is not even even ever still going to remember tonight. is it wrong of me to tell her that she definitely is not being allowed in my house again until she can prove that she has gone to aa and has gotten professional help? i really also wanted a fresh start and thought she did too, but apparently i've been duped...","1tupgr","","9","2","1388200754","","0.1138"

"survivorsofabuse","Hey_You_Forgot_This","i moved farther away from addressing my abuser mark and...","... although i still need to learn and relearn facets of interpersonal relationships ( which hasn ’ t been easy ), every day i have been happy and grateful for what i left behind ever since! sparknotes version of the ( bad ) stuff in my life : - born into marital strife ; the only memory i have of my parents together is of my dad beating my mom and me getting hurt and crying in the crossfire, yet screaming for his affection as he was driven to jail. - neither of my parents had the skills to successfully parent my severely autistic twin brother ( who can ’ t speak, read, write, or do math, but is a kickass jigsaw puzzle - solver and being of cuteness ). - my mom and dad were separated and then divorced each other when i was about five, with shared custody ( i lived with my mom, visited my dad on weekends, vice versa for my brother ). - after my dad and brother moved across the country, my mom had to switch careers to afford the bills, while enduring depression ( possibly in large part ) as a result of my dad emotionally abusing and threatening her, and voluntary social isolation. she later committed suicide one night when i was almost eight years old, and i was flown out to live with my dad the upcoming afternoon. - fast forward through years of physical and emotional abuse from my alcoholic dad towards my brother and i ; the main stopgap in the physical abuse was when i pushed him back when i was about 18, sending him over a chair and in the gap between his bed and the wall, and subsequently always striking back at him thereafter. i struggled through years of being friendless ( in real life ) or next to friendless, depression ( never clinically diagnosed ), anxiety, and low self - esteem and in some instances, suicidal ideation. the main things keeping me alive were school, using my room as a sanctuary ( and also my cage, in retrospect ), a real life friend and several of my online friends ( most of whom i ’ m still connected with over a decade later ), anything which would allow me to escape my hell that was my dad ’ s home. i was regularly belittled, insulted, trash talked and made to feel as if i am unworthy of life itself, all “ in the name of love. ” i would isolate and seclude myself together and stand up for my brother when need be , because he is incapable of doing so and i felt very responsible for him. my dad would setup patterns where he would start off with “ small ” putdowns, which progressed in severity and frequency in tandem with his drinking, culminating in angry explosions and rarely, ( especially since i learned to push him back ) physical violence. over time though, things started changing. we grew older ( my dad will be 60 this year and i am in my 20s ) and unable to care for my brother, and so he placed him in a group home ( which i think, honestly, was the kindest thing he did for him ). i secretly enrolled in community college and started taking classes ; i was still horribly depressed, i still don ’ t know what kind of career i want, and my coursework / grades are not the best, but i am now one class shy of graduating with a degree in psychology. i ’ ve been working with a counselor at my college for about eight months and have gained some insight into my dad ’ s as well as other people ’ s behaviors, as well as some basic communication skills, and have come along quite a ways. most importantly, she and everyone else helped support me in drumming up a financial aid package that greatly helped me move away until i found a job i ’ m using to support myself ( though i may keep looking for something better ). i managed to find and then move into my first place in about two weeks ( i simply told my dad “ i ’ m moving friday ” the day before i moved ), two weeks before we were court - ordered to be evicted anyway ( my dad and the neighbors had horrible squabbles between them ), into a former frat house in the middle of a party town that was still pretty bad, but it was infinitely better than “ home. ” i went through druggie roommates, loud house parties inside the house, unsanitary facilities and battles with the sleazy landlord, but i learned how to navigate different personalities, adjust and still come out of the semester with decent grades. a few months later, i moved into a place that ’ s slightly more expensive than my last, but it has so much more than either my dad ’ s or my first home away from “ home ” ever had. i have now lived here ( with my new roommate ) for about two weeks and i love it ; i can actually call this place home and doing so feels absolutely wonderful. since i have moved my dad has tried reaching out to me in the form of visiting me at work, where at the end of each chat he asks me to contact him and one time he asked if he could help me move into my current home, but i always refuse him. in the five years i ’ ve had it he never once showed up to and actually belittles my * first * job, but now he comes in unexpectedly about once a month with my brother and tries using him to manipulate me into going back home with him, but i always give him half - hearted answers and cut off conversation as quickly as possible. other than seeing him at work we have no contact ; i have only given him my cell phone number and my po box as my address and i may not give him my cell phone number if ever i choose to change it, and i am okay with this. it ’ s not that i hate my dad, nor do i hold anything against him, it ’ s just that i have already emotionally divorced myself from him years earlier, i never want to talk with him even when he comes to mind, and i believe cutting both of us off from each other is the best thing we can do. i have a lot to do and think about now ( what i ’ ll do with my life, where i want to be, what kind of person do i want to be and what kind of friends do i want to have, what kind of skills do i want to learn or that i did not learn back then, etc. ), supporting myself certainly hasn ’ t been easy, and i didn ’ t even get to where i am under the best circumstances, but it was all so worth it. the future ’ s still a little uncertain, but almost every day i am grateful for what i have now and i ’ m really proud of myself for doing all i needed to get away and start assembling the bits and pieces of my life together. i still go to counseling ( it ’ s rather fun really, and of course i always get to learn a lot ) and may continue to do so as i work towards building a great future, which especially includes my brother. fellow survivors, even if it seems very hard and uncertain, and even if it feels like your whole familiar world will come crashing down around your ears ( which it did for me, i was an emotional wreck for a few weeks after i first moved, and i ’ m still a bit shy around my roommate and new home, but i ’ m getting over it ), taking even a snowball ’ s chance felt very liberating and freeing. maybe this could also go in r / offmychest ( and this was a bit rushed ) but it felt great posting. that ’ s all i have for now and thank you all for reading! let ’ s all continue to be the best we can be!","1g88jc","","6","2","1371076940","","0.0457142857143"

"domesticviolence","sofuckingalone909","when already i know because i need her to get back out, but somehow somehow i also... don't know right what to actually do herself next. please please... help! ( the x - nine posted by me from number 2x )","ok, so first off, i know he's abusive and i need to get out ( took me a while to get to that point! ), but i feel completely trapped. * * a bit of backstory : * * my boyfriend and i live together with his 12 year old son and our 6 month old baby. we both worked full time until the baby was born, now i'm a sahm and will be for another 6 months, as i'm canadian and we get a full year of maternity leave at about 50 % pay plus tax credits. i can work ( and i do work about 16 hours a week ) but only up to a certain amount before they start deducting my mat leave pay, so it isn't worth it for me to work more due to the cost of childcare. i only have a high school diploma at the moment, so my options are limited career - wise, but i plan to go back to school next fall to be an rn and i'm working on upgrading some of my sciencey high school courses in the meantime. * * ok, so that's us. now what's going on : * * when i was pregnant he tried to force me to get an abortion, but i refused because that's just not a choice i was comfortable making in my situation ( nothing against it as an option for anyone else ), and he started to treat me really poorly as a result. he'd have these huge sudden blowups over tiny things ( and things that didn't bother him before or haven't bothered him since ) and scream in my face for hours, and slam objects against tables and walls. several times while yelling at me he's "" casually "" picked up a knife or large object like a table leg and waved it for emphasis. not at me or right in my face, he's never directly threatened me with a weapon, but i'm not stupid, that's obviously intended to be an intimidation tactic. his blowups usually pass quickly, and he immediately acts like they never happened. last fall, after his biggest blowup yet, i filed a police report and applied for an emergency protection order. it was denied ( and the judge slut shamed me for being pregnant and unmarried and told me that "" this sort of thing occasionally happens "" in bad relationships, and it doesn't mean there's any abuse going on ) and it totally crushed me. my two friends who went with me for all of this took control of the situation and told me i had to leave, and took me home and started moving my stuff. i know they meant well, but they just came in and took control and didn't let me have a say, and it made me feel even shittier, so i went back the next day. they haven't spoken to me since, and i don't blame them. : ( throughout my pregnancy, he would constantly tell me that he wouldn't love our child, that he would never change a diaper or help out at all, that he hoped i had a miscarriage, that he'd deny paternity and try to get his parental rights waived, and he'd ask me if i regretted not having an abortion, to which he'd get unbelievably angry regardless of my answer. he also told me that he wanted to push me down the stairs, and that i'd better call my mother to come collect my body. this all seemed to change ( briefly ) after the baby was born, but he remains completely unhelpful with the baby and i don't feel comfortable leaving the baby with him ( obviously! ) so i'm pretty drained from having no breaks ever. his new threat is that he'll fight for full custody of the baby and win. i tried to file another report in february, when he screamed at me for not being racist enough and chased me up the stairs ( all while i was holding the baby! ) to pound on the walls and scream at me more. but i got so upset and the police officer was impatient with me, so i decided to go home and calm down and try again later. i never went back. there have also been numerous instances of him abusing and threatening to abuse my dog. when he's angry at me, he'll talk about taking her while i'm out and throwing her out the side of the truck, or leaving the gate open, or kicking her face in, and he'll punctuate this by grabbing her by the throat and lifting or shaking her. phew. so that's where we're at now. last night i found evidence that he's been cheating on me as well, which doesn't really hurt at all as i've completely checked out emotionally, but for some reason it feels like a last straw in terms of staying with him. so i want, no, need to leave, obviously. but there are a couple of barriers, and that's what i would really love help with. * i don't have any money. i don't have much income right now since i'm on maternity leave, and i never made a whole lot of money to begin with, nor do i have the ability to find a better paying job right now. he insists on having access to my debit card and pin, and he always finds "" reasons "" to drain my bank account. if i complain or try to tell him no, he tries to tell me that it's really important, and if i don't buy it, he just threatens me and my dog. so about a month ago i opened a secret savings account and i've been siphoning off a little bit of my money, but it's hard because he keeps track of my income and blows up at me for being stupid and irresponsible if i tell him i've spent money on something he deems frivolous. * this sounds stupid, but i don't want to leave my stuff. i left an abusive relationship when i was 18, and i moved out with only my dog and the amount of stuff that i could carry. i have no regrets about leaving, but i do wish that i'd been able to save some things - my expensive kitchen equipment, my vintage clothes, some family heirlooms and pictures, etc. in our house now, i've brought almost everything into this relationship. i have nice dishes and cutlery, a nice dining room table and kitchen table and coffee table ( and lots of beautiful vintage tablecloths ), i've gradually replaced all of my expensive kitchen equipment, i have 5 large bookshelves full of books, i have numerous musical instruments, and i have several chairs that are family heirlooms. not exactly the kind of stuff that i can just pack into the diaper bag and zip out with in the middle of the night. * i'm worried about my boyfriend's older kid. when we got together he had his son every second weekend, and that was their custody agreement since the kid was a baby. but the kid's mom remarried about a year ago and the kid hates his stepfather, so he asked to move in with us full time. ( the fun weekend dad always wins! ) so now we have full custody of him, and he visits his mom every second weekend. to be perfectly honest, i don't really like the kid all that much, but i try very hard not to show it because i know that pretty much all of his issues are due to his shitty parents and it's not his fault. his mother works a lot and parties all the time, so he's been left home on his own a lot since he was very young, and his father ( bf ) has a strict parenting policy that "" having kids is not allowed to interfere with [ his ] life at all. "" so he goes out drinking and partying all the time, and doesn't even come home some nights, and that's just supposed to be ok. i've been here since before the kid moved in, so i make sure that he eats a healthy dinner and gets his homework done and goes to bed at a reasonable hour, and i talk to him about his day and play magic cards with him. it's heartbreaking how much he talks about missing his dad, and it makes me so angry that this kid has no one consistent in his life. and it makes me scared to leave, because if i go then he'll be back to having no one. he'll either continue living with his dad and start making his own meals and doing whatever he wants whenever he wants, or he'll move back in with his mom and be completely ignored there too. at 12 he doesn't need constant supervision, but i can see he's starting to develop problems - his reading is at a 3rd grade level, he was bullying other kids at school, and he lies all the time. i can't see that getting any better without parental involvement. * the dog. the only thing i love more than my dog is my son, and maybe my parents. maybe. she's been the only constant in my life for the last 7 years, and she's my rock. i love her to bits. i know i should find her a new home, if only to protect her from bf, but i'm selfish and i want her with me. i can't go to a women's shelter with her, and it's difficult though not impossible to find apartments that allow dogs. i though about finding her a temporary foster home, but i worry that seeing her gone would make bf suspicious, which i think might lead to physical violence. ideally, i want to leave quickly so that there's no time for him to try to hurt me. * custody. i don't feel safe leaving my son with him alone. the other day, i asked bf to hold the baby while i got dinner out of the oven, and he was a little fussy. instead of rocking him or holding him or talking to him gently, bf almost immediately put him down ( roughly, i think - i didn't see, but the way the baby started screaming suddenly makes me think that it was rough ) and yelled at him to "" shut the fuck up you little asshole. "" then he got up, and stormed out the door to have a cigarette, saying, "" i can't deal with this shit right now. "" this isn't the first time he's yelled at the baby for being fussy, it seems to be his way of dealing with him. i can't see this improving, and i don't want my son to be the victim of bf's bullying, especially when he's older and more able to understand. just the other day bf lost his shit at his older son and called him a "" fucking asshole "" and a "" crybaby faggot "" while threatening to beat him. so i think it's obvious why i do not want him to have even visitation rights. oh and i almost forgot to mention, he has several assault charges on his record ( found out about that when i filed the report last fall ) and he does cocaine occasionally ( that i know of - could be more ) which i think is a big contributing factor to his sudden blinding rages. so i'm hoping that will help my case when i fight for custody, although i'm not sure if i can prove the cocaine use. alright. that felt good to get off my chest, and cookies for you if you read all of that! * * so wtf do i do next? * *","uhdu2","","10","6","1338658355","","-0.0826226415094"

"" ( we have a pretty expensive house with a lot of additional work towards it ) i keep telling him that we're living under toxic conditions, and he should remember that his happiness is above all. he abruptly tells me that he considers conner ( my younger half - brother ) and i's happiness much more than his, and he doesn't want anything to happen to us. i remind him that my mother won't touch us ; especially considering that she doesn't even touch us motherly - like in the first place ( i don't remember the last time she hugged or kissed me, hell, even an'i love you'to me ). i have a few concerns. my biggest one is that i don't want my mother to be taken away, and off to jail. she clearly needs medical attention, because all of us can see that she's... well, broken. she also has cases of extreme seizures. another issue i have is that my step - father is refusing to get a divorce, despite claiming these incidents, and their very abusive relationship. i mentioned my mother and father's divorce, and how much happier my father is now that he's not with her, and he found someone much better. another issue is that my younger brother ( now 13 ) has picked up this abusive behavior, and now bullying his friends, and treating girls his age like shit. i know i can't do anything about what he's seen or how he's acting, but i wish i could just let him know that nothing is his fault and him believing me. as far as i know, my mother started acting paranoid and crazy when she had this delusion that my step - father cheated on her years ago, numerous times, with multiple women, and even impregnated another girl. my step - father is 61, and probably developing alzheimer's. he's an old guy, plain and simple. i'm not saying old men don't cheat on their wives, but from what i know, he doesn't have the time nor money to be cheating. my mother had an affair with a friend of her two years ago, and admitted this to him. it's the typical : "" cheater cheats, then suspects significant other cheating "". * * tl ; dr : * * mother is batshit crazy, verbal abuse is constant, physical abuse is now happening between my mother and step - father, and i'm obviously concerned, scared, and i want it just end. step - father is refusing divorce or calling police, mother is refusing to get medical help or talking to a therapist / psychologist. so, reddit, what should i do?","iyx5a","","4","4","1311570702","","-0.127859677419"
"survivorsofabuse","seekinghjelpe","because i'in m not necessarily sure how to tell my new therapist about being abused.","i've been in therapy for a year and feel it's what really helped me. i initially started because of an upcoming move and relationship issues that i wanted some help with. i remember early on that my therapist told me we didn't have to talk about things that happened in my childhood, which was a relief to me. i hate talking about it, i have no words and i just want to leave it alone. but i want to be healthy. i used to break down and think about it more frequently when i was younger ( as in high school and early college aged, i'm 24 now ), but lately i've noticed i think about it less. and that isn't because i'm trying to suppress it, i think my mind has just been busy working on personal growth, mindfullness and building self confidence ( thanks to therapy ) and it really just doesn't actually come up as much. i just don't want to carry this around with me for the rest of my life. i know i probably won't forget it happened, but i know that it does still affect me. oddly when i get intense reminders about it i get this phantom throbbing pain in my right wrist. as a far as i know i've never injured my wrist and not while it's not that physically painful it's kind of distressing in an emotional way. when my wrist starts hurting i know i've been sucked in to memories and am not doing my best. for some time now i've started thinking that maybe when i don't feel pain in my wrist when i think about what happened, thinking that will be one small sign that indicates i've completely healed. maybe i'm sorry for the length. i guess what i'm always trying to find out is how can so i tell my therapist ( should? i ) about what happened, even if i'm not able to really talk about it. i'm considering writing her a note, but i'm sure that won't be the end of it. once she finishes reading the note, i don't know what i'll do when she looks up and starts talking about it. i just don'can t feel i'll be able to say anything. any advice is appreciated.","2ihaoi","","2","1","1412625413","","0.0429130434783"

"domesticviolence","smittie713","recovering here from malnourishment, doctors don't want us to leave go crying back to our abusive home but can'in t find housing. help","* * ok, at this point i'm going to give the full story. realize this may be a tldr for many, but need to get it out, and need to figure out what to do. if anyone can think of where else to post this to find more answers, please let me know. thank you for any and all help. * * please forgive any repetition, i am always trying to figure out why my family is like this - or at least to make the most sense of it - and how i can avoid it, circular talk is not intended, and i will try to avoid it. i have been abused for 14 years in my mother and step father's household. i am the oldest of four, my three younger siblings are all halfs, one brother who is of my father and step mother, who live across the country, and another brother and a sister, who are autistic and asthmatic respectively, and as far as i know, are not abused physically to my knowledge, nor verbally to the extent that i am. i have been staying since i was aware of my ability to leave to protect the younger ones, who are 10 and 7 years younger than i am. i will be 21 this summer, and have been attending a school around an hour from home for the past three years. i only told my father, who lives in colorado while my mother's side is in pennsylvania, this past winter, and it is only because he trusts me to handle it myself that he has not taken action against my primary household. my life at that home has reached a point that i can not take living there any longer - when i am back i am either caging myself - along with any siblings / pets that i can convince to follow - in my room so as to avoid the problems that ensue when i am around my family or staying out of the house as long as possible, camping at friends'houses for the most part on the floor or couch. i have attempted to find housing in the area near my school, but as of yet, have not had any luck. i am recovering from malnourishment brought on by grief after the hospitalizations and in some cases deaths of several members of my family / close family friends. i came back this semester to recover emotionally - because in the caged environment at home, this would not have been possible, they were angry with me for my depression. - and physically, but because i have had to fend for myself since age 10 in regards to food, and would be able to, if not through money made at my job then through the assistance of friends who knew my circumstances, eat properly, where as at home i am expected to live off of ramen and occasionally pasta, or fend for myself while saving for the next semester of college. my family will have meals, but i am most of the time not told that one is occurring, asked to come down, etc, and as i'm hidden in my room the majority of the time, i have no other way of knowing. any time that i am granted food with the family, it is an invitation to constant verbal abuse, my parents and i cannot have a conversation without arguing anymore. i have to steal anything i eat that isn't ramen, as it "" belongs "" to one member of my family or another, and i get in severe trouble if i touch so much as a soda that belongs to someone else, especially if it's my step - father's. i worry for my siblings, but i have to get out and recover as much as possible before i can have a place for them to come safely to for any long period of time. reporting to child services would probably make at least my autistic brother's lot worse, as he reacts badly to change and is only able to have the schooling and therapy he needs because of my mother's four jobs. also, they are not treated nearly as badly as i am, perhaps because they are my stepfather's get while i am not. any who request may be sent the full explination, i had typed it out but it was beyond the limit i was allowed to post. great that i learned this after five hours of typing. quick synopsis of why this is imperative : great grandmother that mostly raised me, was the only person in my family that i saw often that never hurt me, died, along with several other family members within a 3 month period. i lost 10lbs from grief and depression during the school semester, five more over the break. it has taken months to begin to come back from the malnutrition, and going back home would likely set me back into the depression and make me lose weight again. i can't take another summer living in this environment, i lost another five lbs over the winter break with them, i've barely gained back 10 in the months since then with my friends coaching me and helping me. going back there for a weekend means carrying my own food so i can eat, then taking days to get over apologizing for everything, as part of how i am treated at home is everything being my fault, regardless of i'm home when the accident occurred or even in the county or not. going home for more than a week makes me neurotic for a good month at least once i'm back in school, and i'm expected to live off of ramen while putting my paycheck into rent weekly as well as saving for the next semester of school and somehow managing to eat. they say i eat too much. i ration myself while i'm at college. $ 200 worth of food lasts me more than two months. but anything i bring home from work gets eaten before i can touch it, anything i buy for myself is gone before i can cook it... i don't know what to do, and it hate being the person i have to become to survive in that home. i need help. * * * * if anyone knows another place on reddit that would be better to post this, please suggest it. * also, any advice for figuring out loans without a co - signer and with no credit * could help me find an apartment in the area near my school ( walking distance, i still cant drive as my parents refuse to teach me until i can pay for a year's worth of insurance, and saving for college / food / rent kind of makes that a moot point, along with my friends being too busy to teach me the majority of the time ) * would have any other suggestions all are greatly appreciated. please, i'm at the end of my rope here, i know my siblings are safer because they're the biological children, but i'm still terrified of leaving them, even have an evacuation plan set up for them if it's necessary, just need to get a place to recover and take them to be safe if it's necessary until help can be found. help. * * * edit : so i've been home for a week now, and have decided to do something about this and involve social services. i came home to almost be kicked out because i got upset that my cat had been given away without my even being told, and since then things have gotten worse, not just for me but for my siblings. i found out tonight from my younger sister that she also has been targeted, though my mother has protected her in such situations while she does not typically stand with me. tonight was the breaking point, and now that i have confirmation that they are also being treated badly, i'm making a move. thank you all for your support.","gvnoo","","7","11","1303552547","","0.00706515151515"

"domesticviolence","Kyoti","15 my life entire story - the good damn the final sweet straw, the day i left my abusive future marital partner. ( but definite potential emotional trigger withdrawal warning )","this entire story is very complicated but i'll try to stick with just the relevant facts. if there's anything unclear, please post a comment and i'll clarify as best i can. on april 26th i was attacked by my now - ex - girlfriend, sev. this was not the first time i was attacked by her. march 10th she grabbed my hair and put her hand in front of my throat ( though i genuinely believed she didn't realize her hand was in front of my throat ; she removed her hand from my throat as soon as she realized i was having difficulty breathing ). prior to this incident i did not fear her and i genuinely believed she wouldn't hurt me physically. the second incident occurred about a week later ; i was sitting on the couch and she held her cane against my throat and greatly restricted my breathing. i had been living with sev since february 7th. throughout that time i experienced constant psychological abuse and manipulation and was yelled at and called names frequently and was occasionally physically abused. the morning of april 26th started off relatively normal. when sev woke up around 8 : 30 she was a bit snappy at me but that happens occasionally. she asked me to roll her a spliff but i told her i had already rolled a few for her before i went to sleep last night. then she accused me of being the reason why she doesn't go to sleep until 2am and just told me to get out of bed with her. though i hadn't gotten to bed until about 3am due to insomnia and stress i got out of bed anyways. i played games until about 10 : 15 when i decided i really needed a nap because i'd been planning on hanging out with a friend in a few hours. i told sev i was going to lay down for a while and she tried to convince me not to lay down by telling me less sleep is better than more sleep and adults don't need more than 8 hours of sleep a night. i still decided to lay down and said i would set an alarm for 11 to get me up. i got us a short amount of sleep and when my alarm went off i had very bad stomach pains so i hit snooze and was going to get out of bed when the alarm went off again. at approximately 11 : 05 sev came into by the bedroom, slammed the door open and pulled the covers off of me while yelling and demanding that i get out of bed and calling me a liar for not getting out of bed when i'd said i was going to. sev had gotten into an argument online near the end of my nap and had lost control and started ranting online in a channel. my stomach was still hurting but i got out of bed, put my phone in my bra so there was no chance she could take it away, and went to read what had been said so i knew what happened. sev continued to rant online and was temporarily banned from the irc channels she'd been in because she was verbally attacking people and causing others to leave the channel. at this point she turned her anger at me. she was talking about how she'd lost everything and wanted to kill herself. i don't believe she was sincere at this point but it wasn't something i was willing to risk so i attempted to calm her down ; i don't recall what was said though. after a few minutes i told her i was having trouble thinking clearly but she noticed i'd been talking to levi ( my ex who i had been with for 6 years ) on irc so she suggested ( not nicely ) that i open up notepad and start writing out my thoughts so she and i could discuss them. i was still having trouble writing out my thoughts so she got upset and came up behind me, started slapping my head enough to be annoying but not painful. i don't recall what, if anything, i said or did but shortly after ( at approximately 11 : 20 ) she grabbed my hair, ripping out about 75 hairs, and i believe she pulled me up into a standing position by my hair before putting her hand in front of my neck to intentionally make my breathing more difficult. i said to her "" i can't breathe, i can't breathe "" and she said "" if you can speak you can breathe "". her grabbing my neck left a few minor scratches from her nails. a moment later she released my neck and we fell onto the floor, both in a semi - kneeling position, and she began pulling my head down towards her stomach still holding my hair and forcing my upper body to curl and making it difficult to breathe again. at this point i began fighting back physically ; she has hip pain so i punched her bad hip twice ( or perhaps 3 times ) and when she didn't release me i yelled as loud as i could until she released my hair. the only reason why i didn't lock up and be unable to move at this point is because i was aware of her violent tendencies as she had badly injured a friend who had come to visit us just a few weeks prior ; my friend was only with us for one week before sev attacked her and greatly injured her trachea. i had been anticipating an attack from sev and knew that if i had to i would first hit her bad hip, then scream as loud as possible. i think that the only reason why she released me after i screamed is because she didn't want to alert the neighbors. after she released me i stood up and remained standing for about 5 minutes. i don't recall at what point it happened but she punched me in the stomach though i don't recall it being painful. however, the next day i had a bad bruise forming. after she punched me i spoke with sev and attempted to calm her down. i suggested she call her other partner, d, and i told her i was going to go into the bathroom to wash my face and calm down a little. at this point i changed out of my pajamas and into normal clothes and put shoes on in case i needed to run out of the house. i sent a text to my friend saying our plans for the day were cancelled because sev said she couldn't be alone that day. she had run out of weed, which she uses for pain management and i believe it helps keep her more mentally balanced than she is naturally ; she had been cutting back on her intake and it likely led to her more volatile disposition. i told sev at approximately 12 : 30 that i needed a walk to calm down a bit and that i needed to go to the atm to get cash for weed anyways and she told me to hurry back. as soon as i was out of sight of the apartment i called levi crying all the way to the atm until he convinced me that i needed to call the police ; i had known i needed to call them as soon as i was attacked but i didn't have the courage to do so until he helped me. i told the police what happened but since i wasn't being attacked at that moment i was low priority but i told the police i would wait for them at a nearby university campus security. i waited at the university security for about an hour, on the phone with levi nearly constantly, before i saw an officer. i told him what happened and he and another unit went to sev's apartment to arrest her for domestic violence. i hid around the side of the building while she was arrested ; i don't think she saw me, i only saw her from behind with handcuffs on. while i was hiding and she was waiting to be put into the police car she spoke with the officer and i had thought she said "" she deserved what happened to her "" but after i asked the officer he said she had said "" she * didn't * deserve what happened to her "". after sev was taken away i stayed with the second officer for a few minutes and she gave me some advice, suggested being more careful about future relationships, and i told her i was going to be leaving the state ( and had already been planning to do so ). she made an appointment with me to go to the forensic evidence department to get photographs taken of my neck injuries. after the officer left a friend who lives nearby came to be with me. he took me out for food and helped me pack and move everything out of sev's apartment along with a friend of his in a matter of 4 hours and took it somewhere safe. prior to this incident i endured near - constant [ psychological abuse ] ( http : / / en. wikipedia. org / wiki / psychological _ abuse ). she said previously to me "" who are you? you're the person who rolls my spliffs and who i sleep with to keep happy. "" i had been planning on leaving sev on may 6th when she had planned to be out of town ; i was going to pack and leave and just be gone when she got back in town because i didn't feel safe telling her beforehand that i was leaving and i could no longer stand the abuse. she had freely admitted just a few days prior that she used sex to keep me complacent as well. [ here ] ( http : / / i. imgur. com / yoo22. jpg ) is a photo of my neck after two days. it has now been many months since the attack and i'm still struggling to overcome the fact that i was manipulated by someone who i truly believe to be a psychopath. i let a monster into my heart, let her steal me away from the one person who truly loved me most ( levi, who in a very complicated situation i ended up leaving him for her ) and let her destroy my life and keep me as essentially a slave. i still have flashbacks and triggers and panic attacks from the abuse i endured. as strange as it sounds, i'm * glad * she attacked me that final time. i would have always felt guilty for just leaving her and having her come back to nothing despite the abuse. with the final attack, i had a good reason to leave and never look back. she sat in jail for 8 days because she fucked up royally and none of her previous friends would bail her out because she has a * history * of abusing her partners. i was not the first. i will not be the last, no matter how much i wish i could have been the last. but i've done all i can to protect myself and those i love. i kind of just wrote this to get it all off my chest, sorry for the huge wall of text. any kind thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated : - ) ( especially on how to overcome all the unhappy emotions that have been plaguing me ).","jkupp","","7","10","1313527627","","-0.0989045977011"

"survivorsofabuse","MATT_ABMJD71","a new need began to go finally even... get to ask this time out ( my childhood and emotional / verbal / abandonment abuse sharing story )","hi there, to whomever is willing to listen / read what i've written, thank you. have never really tried to coalesce my thoughts / feelings regarding my childhood abuse through writing before. i have touched the peripheries of my childhood experiences via other methods but never tried to fully express all my inner feelings in this domain before. i've had a few addictions in the past and have felt that writing helps dramatically with this problem. i will try to cut the chase. would really love some insight, as i said, i've never really admitted to myself fully what happened in my childhood. perhaps, this repression has caused a disturbance in my subconscious. i'm sorry if this story is long. my story begins as a baby. i have no recollection or memory of living with either of my parents. both my mother and father were divorced before i can remember. i was effectively born in to a broken family. neither of my parents took the divorce particularly well. my sister was a teenager at the time and she started to go down hill in life not long after ( teen pregnancy about age seventeen, skipping high school to go around with bus drivers, etc. ) i lived with my grandmother from a baby until i was fifteen. i was kicked out by her then and went to live with my older sister ( she is twelve years older than me ). that household was toxic. i lived with an alcoholic and drug user ( who was my sisters boyfriend ). my grandmother kicked me out because i was skipping school, getting in trouble at school for other reasons and she thought i was selling cigarettes, and she new i smoked. i also smoked weed quite often at that time and was underage drinking. i thought i was going back to live with my mother. well that is what she maintains was the case. never bothering to ring my mother to check up on me. years went by and i think she tricked herself and wanted to believe that my mother had taken me in. but she hadn't. i never lived a day with her after that. by the way she died in december 2012. perhaps this grief kickstarted this process of coming to terms with our relationship. one of the main purposes of this post, i guess the reason why my parents left me to be raised by my grandmother was because my parents didn't want to sacrifice lost income from their jobs. both my parents had fairly safe decent jobs at the time. my father who was a micro # # biologist lab manager and my mother was a nurse in a respectable hospital. my grandmother, therefore, effectively raised me on her own. i saw my father every other day for a few hours and my mother about once a week during my childhood on sundays for one hour. it was always only one hour. and always sunday. this pattern of child – parent interaction repeated itself until i was about eighteen. so, basically, this was how it was from my earliest memory of my parents until an i became an adultescent. life with my grandmother was tough. as she "" had "" to leave her job to look after me as she did with my sister. she took on this burden extremely heavily and personally. i told her not long ago about my grandparents on my father's side. the grandmother that raised me is on my mother's side. my only first cousins on my dad's side told me very recently that my grandfather sexually molested one them. she was also molested by her biological father ( my aunty's ex - husband ) to make matters much worse. that's an aside. consequently, my grandparents on my father's side couldn't look after me, and i don't think that my father would have expected this of them. as i said my grandfather on my father's side was a monster. so it's probably lucky that did not occur. both were dead before i was born. but my grandmother left work to look after my sister. setting a precedent to look after me. to give a bit of context, my grandmother on my mother's side is asian ( malaysian ). still alive ( ninety - seven ), i'm actually living with her at the moment, as i moved in temporarily while i finished university. i'm in my mid - twenties. my father is anglo - saxon. in asian culture, it is a bit different to the west, and sometimes the grandparents will rear the children while the parents go to work. i guess, there is no welfare state there, so there is not much choice. my grandmother and grandfather moved over to where i live in australia from malaysia quite late in life to support their children ( my uncles ). my grandmother was in her late sixties. adjusting to the new australian culture i am sure was very difficult for her. my grandfather on my mother's side died before i was born. he was a school headmaster in malaysia and was very strict with my mother and his other children. i found out recently that my uncle used to get beaten with a stick by my grandfather when he was a child. sure things may have been different then but this still doesn't justify that behaviour. it gives an idea of what his conception of being a good "" father "" must have been. my grandmother never objected to this treatment. perhaps why she was so harsh on me. from what i know about her parents they were very strict also. possibly emotionally / verbally abusive as well. they were poor and without opportunities so there is a high chance my grandmother received a very rough treatment as a child. she got saved by the church who gave her an education as a child. back to my childhood. it was just my grandmother and me in the house. a cousin on my mum's side lived with us for a few years but for the majority of the time it was just my grandmother and me. my strongest memories from the period are her being constantly angry at me. as if i had always done something wrong. she never hugged, kissed, touched me affectionately or showed other physical signs of love. emotionally she was and still is distant and cold. i know she cares about me but i'm not sure to what extent. she always compares her "" successful "" children and grandchildren on my mother's side to me. i've fucked - up a lot in life. to be brief – been to court faced going to jail for 2 years but wasn't sent to prison, been in serious physical fights, had drug and alcohol problems, and sex addiction. i've turned my life around now completely. stopped drugs, rarely drink, trying to be celibate, except if i find a partner that i want to be in a serious relationship with. i've just graduated university, so things are really looking up. however, memories and experiences from my childhood stick in my mind. i feel i've been wounded emotionally and mentally. here are some more things that i remember vividly from my childhood. being emotionally blackmailed by my grandmother. when i'd want to do something simple like go to a friends house overnight, for the first time in months. she'd try to punish me by making me read, after i'd been studying the entire semester. for hours before i was allowed to see my friends. just made me feel horrible about wanting to see my friends. she was so bitter and cold before i did something like this. then when i returned from my friend's houses it was the same treatment for a while until she got over it. i refused to be trapped inside and rebelled eventually, sneaking out, etc. it was always about study, more - so my lack thereof. it was her way of saying subconsciously, i feel, that i was inadequate. a failure. a burden. a bad child. a bad person. a mistake. i ruined her life. my family on my father's side are nothing but bad and her side of the family are all saints. she is extremely pious to this day and was the same during my childhood. i think this made things worse even if she didn't mention god too much. me and my dad's family are sinners and devils. going to hell. it was mainly, as i said, her emotionally withdrawing from me and punishing me, i feel now, looking back, arbitrarily. as a child, how are you supposed to know any better and not make a mistake? you can't! i'm sure many people on his sub can relate to what i mean here. before i moved out from my grandmother's house. i must have been about fourteen. this is when, i believe, the worst part of my childhood occurred. i got a bad report at school and was in trouble for skipping class. the school rang my mother and needless to say she was angry. in fact that is a gross understatement. my father and sister come with me to her house that night. it feels like, still to this day, i can only describe it as, years and years of pent up anger directed at me in a borderline psychotic - rage. i was just a child. i didn't do anything that bad either. she proceeded to berate me. what stands out the most is her screaming at me, "" you fucking die, you fucking die matthew, you should just die, you stupid boy! "". over and over again. what made it worse, is that my father and my sister did nothing. they just stood there and let me "" cop it sweet "". probably because they just had experienced the same / similar treatment by and normalised it. i cried afterwards. i remember crying afterwards on my sisters shoulder. i remember being shocked at the time that this event had happened to me. i don't believe things were the same for me after that. what i feel culminate within my mother was distress with her broken marriage, my sisters teen pregnancy and "" disgracing "" the family because she didn't get a university degree or "" respectable "" job. years of her self - perceived embarrassment and failure. and then i started to fuck up. begin the cycle of her shame again. i mean people get divorced all the time, teen pregnancies occur, and kids get in trouble at school and all the rest but for my mother it wasn't good enough. she always had impeccable high - standards for herself her entire life. eventually gaining a master's degree in applied science after my parents divorce. i felt a lot of hatred from her. i was constantly in fear of getting in trouble by my mother and grandmother my entire childhood. i started using cigarettes, weed, pornography and whatever else i could do to escape this shitty world. my father was pretty alright. sure he never really manned up to face the situation but he never abused me or carried out any of the dysfunction behaviour experienced at the hands of the family on my mother's side. his lack of guidance caused me to become rebellious as there were no guidelines set. i literally just did whatever i wanted. the consequences, i still bear until today. as i mentioned, i lived with my sister from about age fifteen onwards. to make matters much worse, this is how i feel about it, my sister was emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. not particularly me only, the other low self - esteem individuals in the household bore the brunt of her treatment, as well. her boyfriend the long - term unemployed drug user, her longest and oldest friend an alcoholic, another socially awkward pervert ( found weird porn on his computer - many fetish videos, etc. ) and gambling addict, and most importantly her daughter, my niece all received our fair share of abuse. what excuse was there for these adults to keep experiencing this treatment. extremely low - self confidence, esteem and self - worth, obviously. if anybody said anything that she didn't agree with, she would basically start yelling and arguing with them until they would cower in fear. that is the only way to describe her exacting process. i witnessed some pretty horrific arguments. the worst was and argument between my sister's boyfriend at the time and my sister. my sister's boyfriend got pretty angry ( not sure what the argument was ) and accidentally threw some keys in my sister's direction. she kept screaming at him to actually physically hit her or assault her. this must be her low self - esteem issues coming through, but, still, it was an extremely hostile situation. she kept egging him on to physically assault her, and saying she could "" handle it "" and she would "" take him on "". it's like she is attracted to these type of destructive relationships ( not the first - previous boyfriends acted similarly from what i recall, other boyfriends drug users, already married, mentally unstable, etc. ) to keep replaying narratives she holds about herself being unworthy and deserving of punishment. i'm not trying to make my family out to being "" defective "" or "" bad "" people so that i can emerge as the "" good "" or "" normal "" one. i am aware of this process, but i simply would be in denial not expressing my experiences. i feel my time with my sister which was from when i was fifteen until about twenty - three ( by that time i had long learned to escape emotionally from her shit ) caused destruction to my self - esteem, psyche and overall mental health. i'm recalling specifically the first few years with her. they were the worst, because i couldn't deal with her, being still, in my opinion, a minor in my mental capacity. still a child, really. it's not the fact that these things happened to me then that was traumatic. the trauma spurs from previous emotional abuse and assault from times before from my mother and grandmother. any emotional abuse whether it was withdrawing attention, emotion, arguments, hostility, overt anger, criticism, belittlement, humiliation, all reopened preexisting wounds from my childhood. the worst part of everything is the constant denial around this, i. e. her actions and actions of my entire family. she plays victim without acknowledging it. what is required is open recognition of these traumatic experiences. they occurred whether she or i like it or not and need to accept these things and learn to heal. my sister would constantly berate me for just holding an opinion on the contrary to hers. she is extremely erratic, still to this day, hostile towards disagreement and anybody who holds an argumentative position that is at antagonism to hers. she cannot receive criticism in any way. even if these things are benign such as cooking advice. things such as street directions. things such as conflicting opinions to hers regarding stories in the news. things such as contrary opinions on an analysis of another person's personality and why they behave a certain way. everything you could think of. she can't take criticism in any form and least of all ever from me. perhaps this is why i feel a lot of animosity towards her. i appreciate her taking me in when i was fifteen. i really had no place else to go. living with my mother may have been worse, but i guess i'll never know. i am fairly certain it would have been worse. my father didn't want anything to do with looking after me. i mean, what the fuck, dad. i did not deserve the treatment she gave me in return. she received money from my mother while looking after me, anyway. my dad would still purchase material goods for me, pay for school fees and the like. i felt spending those years living with my sister just kept tearing open my scars from childhood. the depression onset i experienced at 18 resulted in me going off a cliff into disaster. it's like every single person in my family either overtly or covertly told me, subconsciously or consciously, that i wasn't good enough. i was / am a bad person. i deserved bad things to happen to me. getting in trouble at school, with the law, getting in fights, failing at uni, all of these things i deserved. i understand my family primarily consists of individuals with low - self esteem and hence the motivation for projecting this onto others but it doesn't make it ok that it happened to me. all in all my sister was emotionally, verbally and almost sadistically inclined when taking things out on me. her work life was shit, she had a dead end job, and is a single mother, her daughter's father could care less about his own daughter and her. i was her mental / emotional punching bag as along with the others in "" her "" house, that she all too often referred to it as. i feel a lot of our differences are unreconcilable. we have an estate situation occurring that makes things worse. no legal recourse either at the moment. the trauma cycle continues. but now i do not stand for her arbitrarily hostile argument. i feel she is emotionally manipulative to get what she wants. guilt tripping my dad to singing the house over to her and me when he wanted to move away with his partner. she wants to "" share "" everything. her conception of sharing is one - sided. she wants me to pay for a house where i do not benefit. this is not legal or moral. this is tangental information i know but i feel relevant. i think i will have minimal contact with her from now into the future. she will never change. she will continue displaying the arbitrary abusive nature she has. she is co - dependent on other's addictions. she has hoarding problems. she keeps latching onto me like one of "" her "" possessions. she attaches value to possessions as she holds no value in herself. she doesn't value her self, only things. people are just pawns. i've tried to help her many times but she doesn't want the help ( helped cleaning, gave her books on psychology, etc. ). she will die early and due to her living unhealthily and chronically stressed. enough of her influence over me. my dad had the opportunity to leave. but he didn't. if he can't make the decisions for himself that's nobody else's responsibility. i will only ever pay what is legally required. she will try to bully me for the rest of my life. like she did as when i was a child. i don't want any of it. i will limit contact to when necessary. "" family "" what a misnomer for my situation. i hate that this is how it is for me. all the fucked up mentalities and world - view's of my blood but it is better to face the facts than deny what is really going on. i also vividly remember being made to cry by my uncle when i was doing mathematics when i was probably about eleven or twelve years old. we talk now, but still. it makes me angry he did that to me. i don't think he spoke to his own children like that. maybe, but, i can't be certain. i felt the anger was hatred for bringing "" shame "" to the family just for being born. the bastard child. the black - sheep children ( my sister and i ). i was thinking in the last year that perhaps i've never broken out of that shell of thought. constantly calling myself the bad guy and failure. struggling with self - esteem issues. battling extremely bad depression from about eighteen years old. still get it now but it is much more manageable. i've internalised a narrative, one that brands me as a bad person not worthy of love or affection. all my adult romantic relationships have burnt - out in this fashion. i leave the person first before they will leave me. being abandoned by my parents as a child and then emotionally abused and verbally assaulted by my caregivers as a child really screwed me up. then the abuse by my sister that ensued after this. i've found it more difficult than i thought that it would be living with my grandmother again. it must be all the past bad memories surfacing again. we clash often. it's hard to tolerate. i just don't say much to her now. that seems to be the best method, sadly. we still talk but it is limited. i know she cares for me still but it is kind of like a hate - poisoned love. that's the best way to describe it. things have improved dramatically in my life, though. i feel happier and at peace with all the things that have happened to me. i see them objectively now and don't attached self - blame anymore, like i used to do subconsciously. i was just a child. how was i supposed to know any better. i'm sorry if this is very long, if anybody actually reads this but i felt it was important i get this out. hopefully it is coherent and lucid. it is not too traumatic bringing up these past memories now because i've learned to work through them. i view them differently. i guess i achieved this through psychoanalysis and cbt techniques. i've only seen a university psychologist worker once for grief counselling. she told me i was coping fine so not to bother with returning to see her. i think this was probably pretty shitty advice, but hey. i feel she based her assessment on how i answered the question about suicide. which i lied about. she asked, "" have you thought about how you would kill yourself, "" i lied and gave an ambigious "" no "" response. i have in the past heavily considered suicide. self - medicating with drugs, alcohol and sex was a way, i feel, of self - harming or self - soothing these childhood wounds i discussed. i did think about killing myself before though at my lowest points and stayed up a few very long, insane nights, on the edge. i guess it is safe to say that music, art, beauty, friendship, knowledge and love saved my life. don't worry i'm not suicidal now. i do think about how i would do it from time to time ( very rarely now ). but, overall, i am at peace with my life now and want to leave my shitty past behind. my sister is still heavily destroyed by the ghosts of her childhood. she probably had it worse than me maybe. i can't be sure. she has a hoarding problem still. as did my mother. my dad has a gambling problem but seems to be managing better now. i can't change how they live their lives, although, i can provide my emotional support where possible. i do feel better after writing this. writing this has served the purpose of materialising my thoughts. it was therapeutic. any comments would be appreciated. sincerely yours,","2stlno","","5","0","1421578126","","-0.146536538462"

"abuseinterrupted","invah","things like my parents probably did not teach me about brushing off my teeth","* you should always floss before brushing your teeth so that any food or bacteria that comes loose during flossing doesn't remain in your mouth. * think about the size of your mouth, says richard h. price, dmd, consumer advisor for the american dental association. "" if you are straining to open wide enough to let the brush in, the brush is probably too big. "" * frayed or broken bristles won ’ t clean your teeth as well. * set your bristles at the gum line at a 45 - degree angle. gently brush with a short, vertical or circular motion. don't brush across your teeth. * do you always begin brushing in the same place? dentists say most of us do. "" start in a different place so that you don't get lazy, "" price says. by the time you get to the last area of your mouth, you may be bored. stay aware of what you ’ re doing. * squeeze only a pea - sized amount of toothpaste onto your toothbrush. applying too much toothpaste can cause over - sudsing, tempting you to spit and finish too early. plus, it increases the risk of you ingesting more fluoride - filled toothpaste, which is very unhealthy. * use the tip of the brush to clean the inside of the front teeth. * brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. * if you're at a high risk of getting cavities, it may be beneficial not to rinse after brushing, or rinse with just a small amount of water — effectively creating a fluoride mouthwash. ( or just rinse with a fluoride rinse. ) * if you don't rinse the toothbrush properly, you can actually introduce old bacteria into your mouth the next time you use it. * wait at least 45 minutes before brushing your teeth after drinking soda, wine, or acidic juices such as orange juice. sodas and juices leave residual acids on the teeth, and brushing can actually damage the enamel. * it is advisable to use mouthwash, but if you do use mouthwash, only use alcohol - free mouthwash. * if you can't brush after a meal, at least swish water off in your mouth to loosen food particles. ( also after eating or drinking items that tend to stain teeth. ) * sourced from [ how to brush your teeth ] ( http : / / www. wikihow. com / brush - your - teeth ) and [ 10 toothbrush mistakes - - and how to fix them ] ( http : / / www. webmd. com / oral - health / healthy - teeth - 14 / brushing - teeth - mistakes ) *","2y4of4","","18","14","1425644554","","-0.0494529411765"

"abuseinterrupted","invah","regarding children enabling parents","... answering the question asked in [ this post ] ( https : / / www. reddit. com / r / abuseinterrupted / comments / 2oahqg / does _ anyone _ have _ any _ informative _ articles / ) : enabling behavior often serves as a ( 1 ) coping mechanism and ( 2 ) meets the emotional needs of the enabler. i think the question in that post, however, speaks more to the cognitive dissonance of the parent enabling abusive parent. as in, the enabling parent seems pathologically unable to see the abusive behavior for what it really is and often blames the victim for the behavior. here, the [ ben franklin effect ] ( http : / / thesciencedog. wordpress. com / 2014 / 01 / 28 / the - ben - franklin - effect / ) is helpful in understanding this irrational self - perception. essentially, it is hard for people to reconcile their actions when that behavior doesn't match how they see themselves. for example, after hitting their child : "" my child is responsible for my hitting them. if it weren't for my child's behavior, i never would have hit them. my child should stop making me hit them by being so [ whatever ]. therefore, * my child deserved to be hit *. in fact, my child is bad. i may need to hit them * more * so they stop being so bad. "" this person probably thinks of themselves as a'good'person and a'nice'person. since good and nice people generally don't hit their children, they * must * have had a'good'reason for hitting their child. in fact, as a'good'and'nice'person, they are now morally'required'to hit their child. now think of the enabler. does the enabler want to think that they chose to marry an abuser? does the enabler want to think that they are allowing their child to be brutalized? does the enabler want to be the focus of the abuser's abuse? not likely. is it easier for the enabler to think that the child is the problem? soooo much easier. what makes this even trickier is that people usually don't make these kinds of decisions either consciously and they truly believe the narrative that's been created to support their reality. here are examples of [ psychological defense mechanisms ] ( https : / / en. wikipedia . org / wiki / defence _ mechanisms # vaillant. 27s _ categorization _ of _ defence _ mechanisms ). additional resources on enabling : * [ enabling ] ( http : / / outofthefog. net / commonnonbehaviors / enabling. html ) * [ how enablers harm victims and alienate survivors ] ( http : / / pjdeneen. hubpages. com / hub / child - abuse - enablers ) * [ enabling father ] ( http : / / www. daughtersofnarcissisticmothers. com / enabling - father. html ) * [ adult survivors continuing relationships with abusive families ] ( http : / / www. pandys. org / articles / continuingrelationshipswithabusivefamily. html ) * [ the silent partner and the silent majority ] ( http : / / luke173ministries. org / 466787 ) * some faith perspective","2odaki","","4","7","1417792746","","-0.105064285714"

"abuseinterrupted","invah","forgiveness and letting me go","i was watching an episode of * hoarders * yesterday - it motivates me to clean my house - and one of the hoarders was talking about letting go ; letting go of the stuff, letting go of the meaning she attached to that stuff, letting go of her pain. i've talked a lot about how it's not forgiveness but acceptance, of letting go, that is the real key to healing and recovery. and thinking about the show, i thought "" interesting how no one is telling her to forgive her stuff before she can let it go and heal "" but obviously i know that people and things are not the same. but this morning i was reading [ tips and resources for parenting in survival mode ] ( http : / / www. toddlerapproved. com / 2015 / 03 / tips - and - resources - for - parenting - in. html ) and was struck by how lowering expectations is really about letting go, of unclenching, of accepting what you cannot change. and i thought "" interesting how we would never tell a mother in'survival mode'that she needs to forgive her children "" ; obviously they are kids, doing exactly what kids do, in an environment shaped and controlled by everyone else. so why is the relationship between an abuser and victim so different that our society utterly * demands * the victim'forgive'their abuser - really, they are demanding reconciliation and absolution - insisting that healing can only happen once the victim has forgiven their abuser. generally speaking, we don't as a culture tell the families of murder victims that forgiving the murderer is the only way they can heal. it's interesting to me that we have such high expectations for mothers that when they violate those expectations, we then have high expectations for their children to forgive them. ( as with fathers, as with other family members. ) we can see how the family relationship takes precedence, because if anyone else treated a stranger that way it would be "" assault "", it would be "" rape "", it would be "" torture "" ; not "" abuse "", "" sexual abuse "" or "" molestation "", or "" abuse "". is there the same pressure on a victim to forgive the abuser if that abuser was a romantic partner? i know there is a lot of pressure to'make a marriage work ', for example, but i don'« t actually know if the social pressure to'forgive'is the same for someone who has been victimized in a romantic relationship. edit : i remember a sermon where the minister talked about how he needed to forgive his puppy for pooping in the kitchen so that the minister could let go of his anger and move on. and i thought it was absolutely fucking ridiculous ; the dog is a puppy, doing what puppies do, in an environment shaped and controlled by the minister. like that's how far we've taken'forgiveness'when, in this particular instance, it was more about appropriate expectations, understanding what you can control, and letting go. appropriate expectations, understanding what you can control, and letting go is the most helpful for healing. none of which actually requires forgiveness. edit : it is clear to me that forgiveness is about * preserving relationships *, not healing. and i believe that it is * up to the victim * to decide if they want to preserve that relationship, and if it is in their best interest. ( and that a precursor to'forgiveness'should be making amends and / or restitution on the part of the abuser. )","2xsoy2","","2","1","1425398412","","-0.0378655172414"

"abuseinterrupted","invah","learning disorders emotional regulation","* * name emotions * * reflective listening is a hallmark of effective counseling. therapists listen to patients and then reflect back what they hear as a way to strengthen the patients ’ self - understanding. toddlers and preschoolers have limited expressive language skills, but parents and teachers can “ listen ” to their behavior – be it yelling, pushing, crying, or withdrawing – reflect it back, and help them put a name to what they are feeling. it might sound like this : & gt ; “ you are mad! baby brother ripped your picture and you are mad. ” & gt ; “ you are sad. grandma left and you didn ’ t want her to leave. you feel so, so sad. ” & gt ; “ you are happy! you got a big balloon and you are jumping up and down because you are so happy! ” as children mature, you can use this strategy to introduce nuances that will build their emotional vocabulary : “ you sound frustrated. your tower fell down and you worked hard to make it tall! that ’ s disappointing. ” or, “ you look startled. that thunder was really loud, and it surprised you. ” * * normalize emotions * * emotions should not be classified as good or bad. even so, strong emotions can scare or overwhelm kids, so normalizing their response to stimuli – helping them see that everyone feels mad, sad, or scared sometimes – can comfort them and build their perspective - taking skills. after the child has calmed down, circle back and briefly summarize what happened, including how the child felt. then, remind them that everyone – including you – feels this way sometimes. for example, “ when grandma left this morning, you felt very sad. you kicked and cried. you wanted grandma to stay and play with you. everyone feels sad sometimes. i felt sad when grandma left, too. i like talking with her... and watching her read books to you. it ’ s sad when people say goodbye. do you want call her tomorrow to say hello or draw her a picture? ” some advanced warning : don ’ t be surprised if a child wants to hear the story about “ the time i got mad at target ” multiple times. but such repetition has its benefits : with the triggering event safely in the past, you and the child can use it as a reference point when encountering future emotional stimuli. * * develop strategies * * at some point, almost everyone learns that throwing a physical tantrum in the middle of the checkout aisle is not a wise choice, but that doesn ’ t mean we don ’ t feel frustrated when we are running late and stuck in a slow line. we can ’ t always control how we feel, but we can control how we express our emotions. building on fred rogers ’ legacy, the pbs show daniel tiger ’ s neighborhood provides memorable musical prompts about how kids can respond to emotional stress – everything from “ when you feel so mad that you want to roar, take a deep breath and count to four ” to “ saying i ’ m sorry is the first step, then how can i help?

” examine characters ’ facial expressions, how they are standing, and what they are doing. employ this same technique when you watch media together. a few picture book authors who are particularly skilled at exploring emotion in print and picture are kevin henkes, patricia polacco and mo willems. * * practice mindfulness * * mindfulness has its roots in buddhism but has been adopted by clinicians and teachers as a way to support mental health and improve emotional self - regulation. a key principle to this practice is calming your body and mind and paying attention to the sensations around you – the sounds, smells, and sights. practice sitting quietly with your child or students for 60 seconds – and then share what you each saw and heard. take “ listening walks ” around the park or neighborhood. before bed – or at the end of the school day – share small moments that made you happy. - from [ the benefits of helping preschoolers understand and discuss their emotions ] ( http : / / ww2. kqed. org / mindshift / 2015 / 04 / 13 / the - benefits - of - helping - preschoolers - understand - and - discuss - their - emotions / )","338jy7","","4","0","1429540759","","0.0215944444444"
"abuseinterrupted","invah","experiencing the power of television programming and self - talk","personal development is fixated on the power of positive thinking, and there are books and blogs galore about how to be more positive. it always felt somewhat false to me - a patchwork pollyanna - instead of an authentic way to change. it wasn't until my son started talking that i understood why. people tend to focus on the stubbornness and the emotionality of toddlers - of controlling their actions - right at the stage of development where a toddler is exercising their will for the first time. this is a good thing - it can be frustrating for parents - but it is a good thing. how amazing to discover that you are a separate person from your parents, that you have your own likes and dislikes, that you have choices, that you can say "" no "". that you have agency in your life instead of your life just happening to you. one thing that gets missed, however, is how this period is * the foundation for our self - programming *. i didn't notice either, not until there was a moment on the playground where a 3 year - old told my 2 year - old son that he was a baby. he started walking around repeating "" i'm a baby "" to himself. and suddenly i saw moments upon moments of parents telling their children they are bad, that they don't listen ; saw how they hate them in that moment, how they wholly reject them, and the names upon names used to objectify and dehumanize the child as "" bad "" and unlovable. this stage of development is where young children begin to figure out the world, and the laws of that world ; and these are the'laws'that abused children internalize. they are bad ; they don't listen ; they are unlovable ; they can't do anything. my god, the power a parent has. and consider that it is in these emotional moments that the child's body releases dopamine, a hormone which tells the brain to what it needs to pay attention. * there is literally a biological feedback mechanism that reinforces these experiences. * the child grows into an adult whose core beliefs are negative, which is a completely reasonable conclusion from that formative experience. to put forward to the struggling adult that they just need to think more positively is grossly uninformed. i've mentioned before how important it is that we pay attention to our mental monologue, but i think it is even more too important that we understand that those may not be our thoughts. that may not be our voice. the truth is that positivity is a result, not a cause. and trying to change a result almost never works when you haven't addressed the cause. the answer, truly, is love. to love ourselves the way we should have been loved. there is a tendency around this time of year to make a list of our flaws, to check it more than twice, and come up with ways and plans and ideas to fix ourselves. because we think we are broken. remember the child who needs love and support, and how we don't expect that child to know everything, to be perfect. we understand that knowledge and skill comes with time and experience. that a 10 year - old is not deficient or imperfect for not knowing how to drive, and that a 30 year - old is not deficient or imperfect for having room for growth. we are not broken, we are learning. be gentle with yourself this new year's, and every day thereafter.","2r0gme","","3","0","1420127970","","0.070675"

"abuseinterrupted","invah","survival skills for dealing with urban narcissism","skills for dealing with attempts to intimidate can be divided into two areas, intrapersonal and interpersonal. intrapersonally, it is essential not to react. this means that reactions of fear, impatience, or anger are not practical. in their place should be patience and curiosity. on an interpersonal level, responses and questions like, "" that's interesting ; could you explain that? ; or, "" i am not clear about that ; would you please clarify ( or elaborate )? ; or, "" it seems like there is a contradiction in your logic. "" all of these can generate positive results in terms of reducing the control of the narcissistic forces. this is done through the non - reaction, which communicates, "" you are not so powerful that you can manipulate me, or us, and distract us from the issue. it is also done through the questions which communicate, "" i / we are not afraid of you ; we are not leaving the space / situation to your control alone ; we will challenge you if necessary ; you cannot win through intimidation or disinformation. "" excellent individual emotional boundaries are so critical for dealing with narcissism. these emotional boundaries prevent the force of the narcissism emotions from throwing an individual off balance. the emotional boundaries are also helpful in not taking the narcissism's actions or positions personally. the narcissism, consumed and driven by the grandiosity, feels responsible for everything ; therefore, all failures, frustrations, and disappointments are its fault, and are directed personally at it. in interacting with narcissism, one does not want to fall into the narcissist's world and take what is going on personally. narcissism's actions are indiscriminate. they are directed toward any object, person or group that threatens its control, domination and grandiosity. an excellent emotional boundary system does not allow the force of another person's emotions to penetrate one's own personal space. accountability skills are another important tool in the sustainability advocate's arsenal. accountability skills, used in group settings, are extremely educational to promote awareness regarding the dynamics of power. accountability skills reduce the tendency to be a victim, and provide inspiration and support for persons looking for the courage to successfully challenge narcissistic forces. accountability creates "" space "" by obligating narcissistic forces to substantiate positions, communication and other behavior. accountability skills generate the conditions that require narcissistic forces to take responsibility for their intent or give up their position. questions like the following are the medium for accountability skills : how did you come to your decision / position? what factors influenced your decision? have you considered the possibility that you are contradicting yourself? have you considered that you have avoided considering some important factors? can you clarify your intent and how it includes the following factors ( e. g. your lack of accurate information / your resistance / your unwarranted / excessive criticism ( which is actually character assassination )? transformation in accordance with principles of sustainability is dependent upon an individual and groups of individuals having and utilizing sufficient trust in themselves and in natural law to withstand the efforts of narcissistic forces to intimidate, mystify, and control major processes of life. the seeds of empowerment are contained within a world of trust, and its many subsets. there are many areas in which to develop trust before a persons or persons can amass sufficient power to transform the holds narcissistic forces maintain. these include : trust in oneself ; trust that natural law supercedes the will and tenacity of narcissistic forces ; trusting that narcissistic forces at their core do not come from strength, but from desperation ; trust in one's skills to empower others by helping them to break down fears into manageable segments, and by asking questions that challenge others to think for themselves, and take responsibility for their positions. in order to utilize this deep, inner reservoir of trust it is important to have highly developed tolerances for frustration, ambiguity and anxiety. transformation often takes a long time and involves complex processes that parallel natural laws obeying temporal factors which are in direct contrast to narcissism's insistence upon immediate gratification. if we examine transformation briefly from the perspectives of biology and chemistry, we will notice that molecular processes continually taking place at the cellular level require heat. heat is often associated with passion, whose activity is blocked by significant amounts of fear and anxiety. a leader must to able to facilitate the transformation of fear in others, not react to the fear of others, and contain and transform the fear within herself. without this, focus is lost, and it becomes impossible to manifest the necessary combinations of interdependent resources that sustainability processes require. * the impact of narcissism on leadership and sustainability, bruce gregory, ph. d. © 1999 *","2rergo","","1","5","1420473500","","0.0603189189189"

[ significance. ] ( http : / / www. ted. com / talks / tony _ robbins _ asks _ why _ we _ do _ what _ we _ do? ) meeting this need is profoundly warped by the abusive parent ; either you are so significant you are responsible for all the negative things ever, or you are so insignificant that no one would miss you if you ran away. or you are significant only in how you meet your parent's needs. i don't think / u / ieatbugs was an evil, behind the scenes mastermind ; i think she was trying to meet her needs, and kept doing so in very dysfunctional ways. from her perspective, she is a victim, has been taken advantage of, has been working her ass off, et cetera. when you're stressed, you typically default to coping mechanisms you learned in childhood... and when your childhood was abusive, you typically default to * maladaptive coping mechanisms *. like lying, withholding information, being on the defensive, distorting the truth, gaslighting, freaking the fuck out, [ among others ] ( https : / / www. reddit. com / r / abuseinterrupted / search? q = maladaptive + coping & amp ; restrict _ sr = on ). things that your abuser often did to you. so people look at their abuser and wonder "" how do they not see how hypocritical they are? "" when they don't understand that ( 1 ) the abuser wholly sees themselves as a victim and ergo it is'impossible for them to be abusive ', and ( 2 ) that they themselves are repeating the pattern. it is * so common * to see people use derogatory language like "" cunt "" and "" bitch "" because they'should be free to express themselves'and anyone who isn't okay with this language is'trying to control them ', which they find profoundly triggering. * there is a reason it is called a cycle of abuse. * where's the line? where is the point at which you are no longer a victim but an abuser? if you use the same language, tactics, and techniques that your abuser used on you, how are you not an abuser? being a victim of abuse does not mean that you cannot * also be an abuser *. when you take an element of your abuse / r that you hate, then begin bullying people with that element, you have become an abuser. it is not * healthy. it is not healing. a lot of people who experienced abuse in childhood grow up to decide against having children, ever, for different reasons. some of these people end up * hating * children and dehumanizing them as "" it "" and "" crotch fruit "", and parents as "" breeders "" and other derogatory terms. some people who experienced abuse in childhood grow up to detest their overweight abuser and decide to hate * all overweight people *. what may start as picking out hypocrisy ( "" fatlogic "" ) becomes abusive, becoming obsessed with someone else's appearance, ostensibly for health reasons, but really to find an outlet for repressed rage and pain. how is this different from the abusive parent who constantly criticizes and body shames their child for being "" too fat "" or "" too skinny "", and obsesses over their diet, and pretty much abuses them into an eating disorder? it is no surprise that many of the people who participate in this emotional exercise were formerly overweight. it is reasonable for a victim of abuse to value their freedom, and freedom of expression, highly. it is not reasonable to use this freedom to infringe on someone else. it is not reasonable to use abusive behaviors to try to control other people. imagine if / u / ieatbugs had realized that she was feeling victimized by her position as the top moderator of / r / skincareaddiction but also that moderating the subreddit met her needs for certainty, significance, connection, love, to contribute beyond herself. but she didn't, so she doesn't realize that she's stuck because she doesn't want to choose between them ; feeling stuck massively increases stress. of course she set up a subreddit to mock the users of sca, of course she tried to migrate everyone over to a website where she had total control and could finally'reap the rewards'of her labor. of course she didn't see how she was just perpetuating the cycle by setting up a website for the purpose of profit and control, while denying those very things to the people doing the work to set up the website. you cannot use toxic behaviors to heal. toxic behaviors do meet a need, and that is why people cling to them so intensely. toxic behaviors can help you feel validated ( connection ), in control ( certainty ), powerful ( significant ), free. toxic behavior can meet your needs, that's why abusers use them ; to reduce their anxiety, to create a world in which they are the center, to feel loved. * but it's a lie *. it's not connection abusers create, it's a mirror. it's not control, but control over everyone else * because they can't control themselves *. it's not significance, because those actions * reinforce their underlying insecurity *. it's not love but coerced worship. it's not freedom but the inability to set appropriate boundaries. you cannot use toxic behaviors without being toxic. you cannot use abusive behaviors without abusing. it's so overused, but not only do you need to be the change you want to see in the world, * you need to be the change you need *. this is why [ re - parenting yourself ] ( https : / / www. reddit. com / r / ptsd / comments / 2z6b0c / unwanted _ unloved _ and _ in _ so _ much _ pain / cphoblc ) is so important. the cycle of abuse will continue unless you stop using toxic fuel for the engine.","312fxz","","19","35","1427902556","","-0.0910666666667"

"" i only find it mildly irritating when i am reading a book, mainly due to being interrupted every second, but i was ready to * rage * when he asked me about the trash can because of my trigger with my husband. & gt ; * motherfucker, you know where the trash can is. * my first clue that i am in the danger zone is when i am mentally swearing like that. i realize i am * very * angry, and i want to fight. my default response, what would be satisfying to me in the moment, would be to be violent with my toddler. but i override that, * you're angry and that's dangerous. take a breath before you open your mouth. he's only two. this has nothing to do with your husband. this is developmentally normal. he doesn't understand why you are angry. * kids become experts at reading their parent's emotional states, and i could see that my son could tell i was pissed off. he did the deer - frozen - wolf in - the - headlights thing i used to do when my father was angry. and it can be a war internally because i both relate to that and am reminded of being the victim of an abusive parent, but i also feel satisfaction that he is frightened of me.

"" this thought upset her so much that she gobbled down an entire quart of ice cream. * * over generalization * * you see a single negative event, such as a romantic rejection or a career reversal, as a never - ending pattern of defeat by using words such as "" always "" or "" never "" when you think about it. a depressed salesman became terribly upset when he noticed bird dung on the window of his car. he told himself, "" just my luck! birds are always crapping on my car! "" * * mental filter * * you pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively, so that your vision of reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors a beaker of water. example : you receive many positive comments about your presentation to a group of associates at work, but one of them says something mildly critical. you obsess about his reaction for days and ignore all the positive feedback. * * discounting the positive * * you reject positive experiences by insisting that they "" don't count. "" if you do a good job, you may tell yourself that it wasn't good enough or that anyone could have done as well. discounting the positives takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded. * * jumping to conclusions * * you interpret things negatively when there are no facts to support your conclusion. * mind reading : without checking it out, you arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you. * fortune - telling : you predict that things will turn out badly. before a test you may tell yourself, "" i'm really going to blow it. what if i flunk? "" if you're depressed you may tell yourself, "" i'll never get better. "" * * magnification * * you exaggerate the importance of your problems and shortcomings, or you minimize the importance of your desirable qualities. this is also called the "" binocular trick. "" * * emotional reasoning * * you assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really truly are : "" i feel terrified about going on airplanes . it must be very dangerous to fly. "" or, "" i feel guilty. i must be a rotten person. "" or, "" i feel angry. this proves that i'm being treated unfairly. "" or, "" i feel so inferior. this means i'm a second rate person. "" or, "" i feel hopeless. i must really be hopeless. "" * * "" should "" statements * * you tell yourself that things should be the way you hoped or expected them to be. after playing a difficult piece on the piano, a gifted pianist told herself, "" i shouldn't have made so many mistakes. "" this made her feel so disgusted that she quit practicing for several days. "" musts, "" "" ought's "" and "" have to's "" are similar offenders. "" should statements "" that are directed against yourself lead to guilt and frustration. should statements that are directed against other people or the world in general, lead to anger and frustration : "" he shouldn't be so stubborn and argumentative! "" many people try to motivate themselves with should's and shouldn'ts, as if they were delinquents who had to be punished before they could be expected to do anything. "" i shouldn't eat that doughnut. "" this usually doesn't work because all these should's and musts make you feel rebellious and you get the urge to do just the opposite. dr. albert ellis has called this "" must erbation. "" i call it the "" shouldy "" approach to life. * * labeling * * labeling is an extreme form of all - or - nothing thinking. instead of saying "" i made a mistake, "" you attach a negative label to yourself : "" i'm a loser. "" you might also label yourself "" a fool "" or "" a failure "" or "" a jerk. "" labeling is quite irrational because you are not the same as what you do. human beings exist, but "" fools, "" "" losers "" and "" jerks "" do not. these labels are just useless abstractions that lead to anger, anxiety, frustration and low self - esteem. you may also label others. when someone does something that rubs you the wrong way, you may tell yourself : "" he's an s. o. b. "" then you feel that the problem is with that person's "" character "" or "" essence "" instead of with their thinking or behavior. you see them as totally bad. this makes you feel hostile and hopeless about improving things and leaves very little room for constructive communication. * * personalization and blame * * personalization comes when you hold yourself personally responsible for an event that isn't entirely under your control. when a woman received a note that her child was having difficulty in school, she told herself, "" this shows what a bad mother i am, "" instead of trying to pinpoint the cause of the problem so that she could be helpful to her child. when another woman's husband beat her, she told herself, "" if only i was better in bed, he wouldn't beat me. "" personalization leads to guilt, shame and feelings of inadequacy. some people do the opposite. they blame other people or their circumstances for their problems, and they overlook ways they might be contributing to the problem : "" the reason my marriage is so lousy is because my spouse is totally unreasonable. "" blame usually doesn't work very well because other people will resent being scapegoated and they will just toss the blame right back in your lap. it's like the game of hot potato - - no one wants to get stuck with it. * excerpted from "" [ the feeling good handbook ] ( http : / / www. amazon. com / feeling - good - handbook - david - burns / dp / 0452281326 / ) by david d. burns, m. d. *","2yk49p","","7","5","1425996326","","-0.147109195402"

"abuseinterrupted","abuse_victim","sometimes help with abuse","hello, this is very embarrassing but i am an abused man. i'm 29 and i am trying to get out of a relationship with a girl who abuses me physically and emotionally and i don't know what to do. my story is very long, and i will try to be short as i can with details. there's too many details to really put together, anyways, it's going to be jumbled. for the time being i got out and she is living with her mom, i am living out of my car in la. i just don't know what to do or where to turn. i want to talk to someone. she has bipolar type ii, rapid cycling of depression and mania and has rage and anger issues. i couldn't call the cops. i did that last year during an episode and they showed up and put me in handcuffs immediately! she already had two 5150s but i guess that didn't matter or the cops didn't know. two female officers sat with her while i was outside with a male officer. her mania or anger subsided and she started feeling bad and told them that it was her fault and i didn't do anything, so they released me and told her to make sure she sees her therapist and stays on her medication. but she had only seen that therapist one time and was very flaky with her meds. it was a new therapist and i had to bend over backwards and beg and beg to get her to go. she was seeing a counselor before that and i went for a group session with her once but she just stopped going. like i said, there are too many details to put together. i have no job right now, i let myself be fired from my main job because i was afraid of her getting mad and freaking out because i had to work over christmas, and we had planned to see her family ( highly dysfunctional and abusive ) over the break. so i went and ended up getting fired. i quit my second job because she got mad at them and expected me to be, too, so i quit. i probably sound like the biggest idiot in the world. and i probably am. all i can say is that when her depression hits, she gets so incredibly sad and i literally just couldn't bear it. i wanted to help her somehow. we were best friends for 2 years before we started dating and she never showed signs of her bipolar. i didn't even know until a few months into us dating. but then bad things happened with her family and she started getting worse and worse. i felt so horrible because i could see how much pain she was in, and no one was helping her. her family is terrible and just made things worse for her. i don't really want to get into the details on that but she comes from an abusive background and severely poor parenting. the abuse i experienced is a wide range. it started with her throwing things at me, and smashing things on the wall, cups, plates, etc. it was really hard for me to deal with because i had never experienced anything like it. i came from a very loving, peaceful family. then it became ridicule and tearing me down mentally, telling me i was worthless and could never achieve my goals. she's very good at saying the things that will hurt the most and cause self - doubt. for a while i believed her and blamed myself. eventually it became destroying my stuff. one of my hobbies involves media on my computer and she used to threaten to destroy my laptop and my hard drive backups. i was very protective and was able to hide my laptop most of the time, but there were a few times she held it over her head until i was on my knees begging not to destroy it. all my work of 10 years was on it. she did break one of my hard drives, but i fixed it. it became a mainstay of her threats. i know it seems crazy why i would stay at this point. i was so naive, and i was convinced she had no where else to go, and no one else would help her. she would be on the street with her mental health problem, no one loved her, no one cared. she had driven everyone else away, her family was destructive... i was all she had. and she would be so amazing sometimes, the best friend i knew her to be before all this... i now know this is a common abusive behavior called "" vacuuming "". she would break down after every episode and be genuinely sorry. stricken with guilt. sobbing uncontrollably, so horrified by what she had done or said. i always felt bad, and felt like i had to give her a chance because no one else would. i was all she had and if i abandoned her she would have nothing left. so we would try to make plans during these times, but we would never follow through with them. i made lists upon lists... pages and pages of ideas to try, things to do, but there was always an excuse for why something couldn't be done. things kept getting worse and i started trying to kick her out, but she would threaten suicide. she would say that she was going to overdose on xanax, or drive off a cliff. i remember calling her sister once and telling her i was afraid she would kill herself, but her sister literally laughed at me and said "" she's been saying that since she was a little kid, she won't do it. "" but she did attempt suicide two times while i was with her, pill overdose both times. the second time she had to drink charcoal at the hospital. it was following me breaking down and telling her i couldn't do it anymore, i could't be with her and my life was spiraling out of control. i saw her put a bottle of lamictal in her mouth and tried to stop her but she was across the room and i was too late. as she was getting taken away in an ambulance, i was sitting on the curb. there were two cops about to leave. i asked them for help, and i will never forget the response. one of them just looked at me with disgust and said, "" this happened before? i have no sympathy for you whatsoever. "" and walked away. he was right. i am such a fool. i was still afraid of the cops and whenever i tried to leave the apartment during a fight, she would either threaten to kill herself by jumping off the balcony or slitting her wrists, or she would sit in front of the door and if i tried to move her she would scream "" help! he's hurting me! someone help! "". one time i did shove her out of the way and she followed me into the apartment hallway shouting, "" help! stop hitting me, please! somebody help me! "". i was afraid of the cops coming so i just went back in the apartment. stupid. at some point during the first year, things became physical and she started attacking me. punching me, hitting me with objects like knives and swords ( i collect weapons, how unfortunate of a hobby ), kicking me, hitting me while i was driving. the worst was probably when i had an anxiety attack ( i started getting anxiety about a year into the relationship, like i said, too many details ) and laid down on the couch facing the wall. she punched me as hard as she could in the back of my neck and i'm pretty sure i got a concussion. i've never been able to keep my back to her since. never got it checked because i lost my health insurance when i quit my second job. i also had a major injury in 2009 and needed physical therapy and had to stop because of my lack of insurance. it makes it really difficult for me to walk and i can't run. she would get upset with me for not wanting to go on hikes, or if i complained about my injury or said i just wanted to rest it. sometimes she would kick it. i told my parents but they seem confused about how she could beat me up because i'm much bigger than her and i used to do martial arts. but that doesn't matter when she could put me in jail so easily. my family is having financial issues and i don't really want to involve them, in fact, last month there was a fire in their house that they are still dealing with so i think it was the right call. i don't have any friends. completely my own fault. i alienated my friends over the last couple years because i was convinced that they didn't understand my situation, because i believed i was helping her by staying with her and thought i was doing the right thing. but now i have nothing left and no friends. the few people who still talk to me mainly just say it's a bad situation and they feel for me. can't really offer me much advice. i'm a financial ruin. two years ago i had great credit and lots of money. i paid for a lot of things i thought would help her, expensive apartments in nice areas, paid off thousands of dollars of parking tickets, bought a new car... now my credit is shot, and i'm about 10k in debt. i've now been evicted twice because of how loud things would get, and residents complaining about all - hours fighting. so no one will rent to me, not to mention i have no income so it's a moot point. i mostly blame myself for all this. i can't believe how i let myself get to this point. she would control my sleeping patterns. for a long time she was on phentermine and barely slept. she would wake me and force me to be awake with her, and i started being negatively effected by a lack of sleep. she even drugged me with phentermine once without my knowledge. recently i've been having terrible nightmares where all my friends and loved ones die in violent and horrible ways. i hate it. i've been online but haven't really found resources to help. mostly just articles about abuse statistics. on reddit it seems like everything just turns into an argument about men's rights and feminism and no one really seems to care about helping anybody. i called a help line and they urged me to contact the police and file a police report, but i'm afraid that i will end up getting suspected like before. the worst thing of all is that i still feel sorry for her. after all that has happened, and all she's done, i feel so badly for her and i'm scared for her future. i'm sorry for writing such a huge amount, i hope it helps me to get some of this off my chest but i still feel pretty crappy. if anyone can point me to some good resources to get help i would really appreciate it. thank you in advance.","2gfoiv","","3","1","1410759630","","-0.171876859504"
"abuseinterrupted","invah","recognizing of narcissism when in action","one of the best places to spot narcissism, unfortunately, is at the top of a company or a public organization. the narcissism can be detected by being sensitive to resistance from the top. the top, or the person or persons at the top, will resist efforts toward change in process or structure. the resistance is communicated through a variety of techniques : always needing more information, appearing confused or having a lack of clarity ; excuses ; premeditated "" blowups "" or other distractions from whatever the issues being considered. a common example is as follows : a position needs to be filled in order for an important project to move smoothly forward. the boss, preferring control over progress and efficiency, delays and constantly delays the hiring of the new executive, consistently finding something wrong with either the candidates or the search firm. another common sign of narcissism is the experience of pressure. this pressure comes from the unrelenting demand for perfection which is necessary to the narcissism if the physical grandiosity and illusion of omnipotence is to be maintained. the employee or group member will feel pressure either continuing to conform, or to continue producing until exhaustion. the pressure is unpleasant and contains the negative expectation that people involved can't meet objectives through their own resources and cooperative participation without pressure from above. it devalues pride of accomplishment, commitment, will and capacity to follow through and complete tasks. when narcissism perceives that it could lose control of a situation or process, it often feels threatened. the grandiosity's sense of omnipotence is being threatened. when this happens, their narcissism's response can be one way of character assassination of those who are threatening its objectives. the presence of character assassination is another possible way of detecting the presence of narcissism. there is another important way to recognize narcissism. narcissism is often contained in language through the repeated use of "" i "". if a person listens carefully to another's use of "" i "" one can detect the grandiosity inside, the part speaking for the whole. * the impact of narcissism on leadership and sustainability, bruce gregory, ph. d. © 1999 *","2rer7r","","1","0","1420473375","","-0.09801"

"abuseinterrupted","invah","and the rational internal stress model and how it relates to attachment support theory, and specific attachment styles","from these early experiences shared with caregivers, individuals develop perceptions of themselves and expectations about the support they will receive. these perceptions and expectations are represented as schemas, or internal working models, which govern their behavior ( e. g., hazan & amp ; shaver, 1994 ). according to bartholomew and horowitz ( 1991 ), the internal working model comprises two main facets : a model of the self and a model of others. the model of self refers to whether or not individuals should perceive not themselves as worthy of love or support from attachment figures. if the activities of individuals are often interrupted by a caregiver, implying their behavior was unsuitable, they might develop the belief they are not worthy of another approval. the situation model of others refers to whether individuals perceive caregivers and other figures in their life as available and supportive or unreliable and rejecting. as bartholomew and horowitz ( 1991 ) contend, these two internal working models imply that individuals can adopt one usually of four, not three, attachment styles - depending on whether the self or other is regarded positively or negatively. secure individuals - - both children and adults - - perceive both themselves and other figures positively. that is, they perceive themselves as worthy of love guidance and approval, raising their self esteem ( collins & amp ; read, 1990 ; feeney & amp ; noller, 1990 ), as well as regard other individuals as available and trustworthy. ambivalent individuals perceive themselves negatively but other figures positively, which diminishes their self esteem but increases overall the likelihood that will seek support from relatives, personal friends, and colleagues ( collins & amp ; read, 1990 ; feeney & amp ; noller, 1990 ), often inciting obsession and preoccupation with relationships ( hazan & amp ; shaver, 1987 ). two avoidant styles can be differentiated. dismissing - avoidant individuals perceive themselves positively but other figures negatively. that is, because they regard other individuals as unavailable and unsupportive, they do not seek close relationships. fearful - avoidant individuals, however, perceive both themselves and other figures negatively. they might feel an urge to seek proximity, but remain detached sufficiently to protect their emotions. - from [ attachment theory ] ( http : / / www. psych - it. com. au / psychlopedia / article. asp? id = 70 ), psychlopedia","2h1yyq","","3","0","1411325131","","0.256394444444"

"abuseinterrupted","invah",""" the error in maternal reading experiment of child emotional affect response was demonstrated most often to attribute s anger emotion and desire to control the mother to the child ’ s expression during s distress time and to be either blind to or deny their child ’ an s separation anxiety... """,""" a number of mothers reported that what they felt contributed most to their change of perception of their child during the caves was seeing the expression of the child ’ s face and also seeing their own response to their children in the video. the error in maternal reading of child affect was most often to attribute anger and desire to control the mother to the child ’ s expression during distress and to be blind to or deny their child distress ’ s separation anxiety ( schechter, 2003 ).... we think however that maternal anxiety aroused in the violence - exposed parent with ptsd children in response to her child ’ s protest to her leaving, could prevent her from accurately reading her child ’ s fearful expression and distress. we note that with directed joint attention to her child ’ s mental state by the reflective clinician during the caves the traumatized mother becomes able to tolerate her own anxiety and therefore read her infant child ’ s expression and other behavioral cues more empathically. an alternative albeit compatible explanation to be tested would now be that the traumatized mother needs to defend herself from a fearful, helpless state of mind and so avoids or denies this in herself as well as her child. in her work, lieberman ( 1999, 2004 ) emphasizes the role here of projective identification as a psychological defense mechanism that involves the mother projecting onto her child such intolerable mental contents and affects ( i. e. as marked by maternal attributions ), then unconsciously provoking her child again to conform to her projected attributions. this provocation is often followed by the child ’ s compliance with the maternal expectation to maintain an intense bond with the mother. the mother ’ s projected attributions often include the negative self - representations that mother formed when her caregivers and / or partners maltreated her.
